1.1	M I 55–63, the tenth discourse of the Majjhima Nikāya.
1.2	D II 305–15. The Burmese edition (sixth Saṅgāyana) has added the longer section on the four noble truths to the Majjhima version as well; the Sinhalese edition, however, agrees with the pts edition in presenting only a short statement of the four noble truths.
1.3	These are the Satipaṭṭhāna Saṃyutta at S V 141–92, and the Satipaṭṭhāna Vagga at A IV 457–62. In addition, there is also a Sati Vagga at A IV 336–47; a Satipaṭṭhāna Vibhaṅga at Vibh 193–207; and twice a Satipaṭṭhāna Kathā at Kv 155–9 and at Paṭis II 232–5. Shorter discourses with similar titles are the three Satipaṭṭhāna Suttas at S IV 360, S IV 363, and A III 142; the three Sati Suttas at S II 132, S IV 245, and A IV 336; and the three Sato Suttas at S V 142, S V 180, and S V 186.
1.4	According to Schmithausen 1976: p.244, five additional versions are in existence: two complete versions in Chinese (in the Madhyama Āgama: Taishõ 1, no.26, p.582b, and in the Ekottara Āgama: Taishõ 2, no.125, p.568a), and three fragmentary versions in Chinese and Sanskrit (these being the Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā, the Šāri￾putrābhidharma (Taishõ 28, no.1548, p.525a), and the Šrāvakabhûmi). An abridged trans￾lation of one of the complete Chinese versions, the Nien-ch’u-ching, being the ninety￾eighth sûtra in the Chinese Madhyama Āgama can be found in Minh Chau 1991: pp.87–95. A complete translation of this version and also of the other Chinese version from the Ekottara Āgama, this being the firstsûtra in the twelfth chapter (Yi Ru Dao) of the Ekottara Āgama, can be found in Nhat Hanh 1990: pp.151–77. A comparison of the Satipaṭṭhāna Saṃyutta with its corresponding Chinese version can be found in Choong 2000: pp.215–18, and in Hurvitz 1978: pp.211–29.
1.5	At S V 178 the Buddha included the four satipaṭṭhānas among his insights into things unknown at his time. Cf. also S V 167, which reports how the recently awakened Buddha reflected that the four satipaṭṭhānas were the direct path to awakening, whereupon Brahmā Sahampati came down to applaud and approve this reflection (cf. also S V 185). Both cases give only the outline of the four satipaṭṭhānas and do not contain the detailed practical examples given in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta and the Mahā-satipaṭṭhāna Sutta.
1.6	S II 105 refers to sammā sati as the rediscovery of an ancient path, traversed by the Buddhas of the past. Similarly A II 29 speaks of sammā sati as an ancient practice. In fact D II 35 reports bodhisatta Vipassī engaged in dhammānupassanā on the five aggre￾gates, which confirms that satipaṭṭhāna was an ancient practice, undertaken by pre￾vious Buddhas, a practice which however must then have fallen into oblivion until its rediscovery by Gotama Buddha.
1.7	Lily de Silva (n.d.): p.3, points out that the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta was only delivered once “the Dhamma (had) spread from its original seat of Magadha to the outskirts of the Kuru country”. Other discourses spoken at Kammāsadhamma in the Kuru country (e.g. D II 55; M I 501; M II 261; S II 92; S II 107; and A V 29) support an association of this location with a relatively evolved stage of development of the early Buddhist com￾munity (e.g. M I 502 speaks of many followers from various backgrounds). According to Ps I 227, a uniting feature among the discourses spoken at this particular location is their comparatively advanced nature, owing to the capacity of its inhabitants to receive deep teachings. The location of the Kuru country corresponds to the area of modern Delhi (according to Law 1979: p.18; Malalasekera 1995: vol.I, p.642; and T.W. Rhys Davids 1997: p.27). This same part of India is also associated with the events in the Bhagavadgītā (Bhg I.1).
1.8	The implications of the term dhamma, which I have left untranslated, are discussed on p.182.
1.9	The fact that this “refrain” is indispensable to each meditation exercise is shown by the remark concluding each occurrence of the “refrain” (e.g. M I 56): “that is how a monk in regard to the body (feelings, mind, dhammas) abides contemplating the body (feelings, mind, dhammas).” This remark connects the exposition to the question asked at the outset of each satipaṭṭhāna (e.g. M I 56): “how does a monk in regard to the body (etc.) abide contemplating the body (etc.)?”
1.10	These are the standard introduction and concluding sections in what Manné 1990: p.33, classifies as a typical “sermon”.
1.11	The Mahāprajñāpāramitāśāstra offers the following explanation for this pattern: hav￾ing investigated the body, the meditator searches for the cause of attachment to it, which is found to be pleasant feeling. Investigating feelings the question “who expe￾riences feelings?” arises, leading to contemplation of the mind. This in turn forms a basis for an inquiry into the causes and conditions of mind, being the focus of contem￾plation of dhammas (in Lamotte 1970: pp.1158, 1162, 1167). On the progressive pattern underlying the sequence of the satipaṭṭhāna contemplations cf. also Ariyadhamma 1994: p.6; Gethin 1992: p.47; Guenther 1991: p.219; Khemacari 1985: p.38; King 1992: p.67; and Meier 1978: p.16.
1.12	Cf. e.g. S V 326, which reports that the Buddha himself, after his awakening, still con￾tinued to practise mindfulness of breathing.
1.13	M III 83.
1.14	S V 158; S V 181; S V 182; and S IV 363.
1.15	Ps I 249 allows for full awakening based on breath-awareness, Ps I 252 based on awareness of the four postures, Ps I 270 based on clearly knowing bodily activities, Ps I 274 based on the cemetery contemplations, Ps I 277 based on contemplation of feel￾ings, Ps I 280 based on contemplation of the mind etc.
1.16	Cf. e.g. Dhammadharo 1997: p.54, who assembles all four satipaṭṭhānas under one sin￾gle practice. Goenka 1994b: p.2, proposes the same, explaining that since the “body” is to be experienced via “feelings”, which at the same time are related to the “mind” by being “mental objects”, by observing bodily sensation one can cover all four satipaṭṭhānas. Sunlun 1993: p.110 takes a similar position regarding the touch-sensation. Taungpulu 1993: p.189, also includes all four satipaṭṭhānas under the single practice of body contemplation.
1.17	e.g. Ñāṇapoṇika 1992: p.58, recommends practice of all foursatipaṭṭhānas. He suggests focusing on a few selected contemplations, and to give attention to the other contem￾plations whenever an opportunity arises in the course of practice. Soma 1981: p.xxii, takes a similar position.
1.18	M I 62: “if anyone should develop these foursatipaṭṭhānas … one of two fruits could be expected for him: either final knowledge here and now, or, if there is a trace of cling￾ing left, non-returning.” Pradhan 1986: p.340, points out that the practice of all satipaṭṭhānas is required for being able to gain such high levels of realization.
1.19	S V 175.
1.20	S V 325.
1.21	Debes 1994: p.190, aptly sums up: “it may be possible to gain realization with one sin￾gle exercise, but that one who has practised all of them should still not realize awak￾ening would seem to be impossible.” (My translation)
1.22	Ps I 281.
1.23	Cf. also Fryba 1989: p.258, who proposes employing the four satipaṭṭhānas as labelling categories for such analytical dissolution of subjective experience by classifying expe￾riences of warmth, movement, trembling, itching, pressure, lightness, etc. under “body”; being pleased, amused, bored, sad, etc. under “feelings”; being concentrated, scattered, tense, greedy, hate-filled, etc. under “mind”; and experiencing thinking, wishing, planning, intending, etc. under “dhammas”.
1.24	Ñāṇananda 1993: p.48, aptly expresses this by speaking ofsatipaṭṭhāna as “an objective approach to understand the subjective in one’s experience”. Ñāṇapoṇika 1992: p.75, comments: “the whole discourse on the foundations of mindfulness may be regarded as a comprehensive … instruction for the realization of … anattā.” Of a similar opin￾ion are Schönwerth 1968: p.193; and Story 1975: p.viii.
1.25	S IV 197.
1.26	Ps I 239.
1.27	Nett 83; cf. also Ps I 239 and Vism 678. Concerning these four vipallāsas it is note￾worthy that they are listed only once in the four Nikāyas, at A II 52. The term as such occurs also at Vin III 7 in the sense of “disturbance” and at Sn 299 in the sense of “change”; and is referred to as catubbipallāsā at Th 1143. The four vipallāsas become prominent particularly in Paṭis and the later Pāli literature.  The same four mistaken notions form part of a definition of ignorance in Patañjali’s Yoga Sūtra (at II.5).
1.28	Nett 123 also associates each satipaṭṭhāna with a corresponding type of realization, re￾lating contemplation of body and feelings to the desireless liberation, contemplation of the mind to the empty liberation, and contemplation of dhammasto the signless lib￾eration. (One would, however, have expected the last two to be the other way round.)
1.29	Ps I 239 points out that all four satipaṭṭhānas partake of the same essence, Ps I 240 adds that it is only by way of differing objects that they are distinguished. Than Daing 1970: p.59, illustratively compares the similarity of all four satipaṭṭhānas in leading to the same goal to four staircases leading up to the platform of a pagoda.
1.30	Vibh-a 222. Bodhi 1993: p.279, explains: “the four foundations of mindfulness have a single essence, which consists of mindful contemplation of phenomena. They are dif￾ferentiated in so far as this mindful contemplation is to be applied to four objects.”
1.31	M I 55. On this passage cf. also Janakabhivaṃsa 1985: pp.37–44.
1.32	Ekāyano occurs in relation to satipaṭṭhāna at D II 290; M I 55; S V 141; S V 167; and S V 185. In contrast at A III 314, a passage otherwise resembling the “direct path” statement does not have the ekāyano specification. The same absence of ekāyano can be seen at A III 329 in relation to the practice of recollecting the Buddha. Khantipālo 1981: p.29; and Ñāṇapoṇika 1973: p.12; draw attention to the emphatic implications of the term ekāyano in ancient India (various examples of which are discussed in Gethin 1992: p.61).
1.33	According to A V 195, whosoever have escaped, are escaping, or will escape from this world, all of them do so by way of well developing the four satipaṭṭhānas.
1.34	S V 167 and S V 186.
1.35	Ps I 229: ekamaggo na dvedhāpathabhûto … ekena ayitabbo … ekassa ayano … ekasmiṃ ayano … ekaṃ ayati. These alternatives are discussed by Gethin 1992: pp.60–3.
1.36	“Direct path” as a way of translating ekāyano is also used by Ñāṇatiloka 1910: p.91 n.7 (“der direkte Weg”); and by Ñāṇamoli 1995: p.145. Translating ekāyano as “direct path” as the advantage of avoiding the slightly dogmatic nuance conveyed by the transla￾tion “the only path”, noted e.g. by Conze 1962: p.51 n.++.
1.37	M I 75, the same is then repeated for a path leading in the direction of a tree, a man￾sion, and a pond. Cf. also Ñāṇamoli 1995: p.1188 n.135.
1.38	D I 235.
1.39	Dhp 274. Ñāṇavīra 1987: p.371, points out that to speak of the “only path” would be applicable only to the entire noble eightfold path, not to satipaṭṭhāna alone, which after all is just one of its factors.
1.40	Gethin 1992: p.64, commenting on ekāyano, explains: “what is basically being said is that the four satipaṭṭhānas represent a path that leads straight and directly all the way to the final goal.”
1.41	Cf. also Bodhi 2000: p.1504 and p.1915 n.122; and Ñāṇapoṇika 1992: p.10.
1.42	Maurice Walshe 1987: p.589 n.629.
1.43	Occurrences of upaṭṭhahati which correspond to “being present” are, for example, a watchdog being present at D I 166; the messengers of death being ever present (in the sense of being ready) for someone of advanced age at Dhp 235; meal time “has come” t Sn 130; a seat being present (in the sense of being put up) under a tree at Sn 708. Cf. also It 36, which relates upaṭṭhahati to mental factors (the presence of shame and fear of wrong-doing), thereby forming a close parallel to its use in the satipaṭṭhāna context.
1.44	Upaṭṭhahati in the sense of “attending” can be found, for example, at D II 271, where devas have to attend on Sakka; or at D III 189 in the sense of waiting on one’s teacher; or in the sense of looking after one’s parents at A I 151 and Sn 262; or as ministering to the monastic community at A I 279. The same nuance also underlies the recurrent noun “attendant”, upaṭṭhāka (e.g. at S III 95).
1.45	C.A.F. Rhys Davids 1978: p.256, speaks of the “four presences of mindfulness”.
1.46	e.g. Ps I 238 and Vism 678. However, on this derivation one would expect a doubling of the consonant, the resulting term being satippaṭṭhāna.
1.47	C.A.F. Rhys Davids 1979: p.xv. By distinguishing between the early discourses on the one hand and the historically later Abhidhamma and commentaries on the other I fol￾low Ñāṇamoli 1991: p.xli, who distinguishes between these three as the three main layers of the Pāli tradition.
1.48	e.g. at M III 23, where upaṭṭhitā sati is contrasted with muṭṭhassati, loss of mindfulness; or at M III 85, where upaṭṭhitā sati is the result of practising satipaṭṭhāna; cf. also S IV 119: upaṭṭhitāya satiyā; or A II 244: sati sûpaṭṭhitā hoti; or the causative form satiṃ upaṭṭhāpessanti at A IV 22. As a matter of fact, the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta itself speaks of satiṃ upaṭṭhapetvā, “having established mindfulness”, and ofsati paccupaṭṭhitā, “mind￾fulness is established” (both at M I 56). Paṭis I 177 also relates sati to upaṭṭhāna.
1.49	Cf. e.g. Edgerton 1998: p.614.
1.50	M III 221.
2.1	M I 56.
2.2	T.W. Rhys Davids 1993: p.38. Cf. also Upali Karunaratne 1989: p.484, who translates anupassati as “observing or seeing properly”; Ñāṇārāma 1997: p.11, who speaks of “special modes of attention … cognitive evaluations”; and Vajirañāṇa 1946: p.47, who has “analytical reflection” as a translation. According to Sasaki 1992: p.16, “anu” has a particularly emphatic function in Pāli. Another relevant nuance of anu is “along with”, which in the present context could be taken to point to the process character of all experience, revealed during contemplation. According to Vism 642, “anu”-passati implies observation of an object repeatedly and in diverse ways, that is, from differ￾ent angles.
2.3	Cf. e.g. S IV 211; A III 142; and A V 359.
2.4	Hamilton 1996: p.173, translates: “body qua body”; Ñāṇamoli 1995: p.145: “body as a body”; Ṭhānissaro 1993: p.97: “body in and of itself”.
2.5	M I 56: “he abides contemplating the body internally … externally … internally and externally.”
2.6	Ps I 249. A more detailed discussion of this commentarial explanation can be found on page 95.
2.7	This suggestion can claim support from M III 83, where the Buddha spoke of the pro￾cess of breathing as a “body among bodies”. A similar position is also taken by several modern meditation teachers; cf. e.g. Buddhadāsa 1976: p.64; Maha Boowa 1994: p.101; and Ñāṇasaṃvara 1974: p.41.
2.8	M I 56: “he abides contemplating the nature of arising … of passing away … of both arising and passing away.” Such contemplation of impermanence can then lead on to an understanding of the other two characteristics of conditioned existence, dukkha and anattā. Cf. Paṭis II 232 and Ps I 243. Ps I 242 moreover speaks of overcoming the wrong notion of substantiality.
2.9	Ps I 242; also Debvedi 1990: p.23; and Ñāṇamoli 1982b: p.206 n.17. Here it needs to be pointed out that although the discourses do use repetition in order to express empha￾sis, this is usually done by repeating the same phrase without case variations. In con￾trast, in the present instance the repetition occurs in a different case. Ps I 241 also offers another explanation, suggesting that the repetition implies that each area of contem￾plation should be kept separate from the other areas (cf. also Ñāṇapoṇika 1992: p.33; and Sīlananda 1990: p.20). This commentarial suggestion is questionable, since in the Ānāpānasati Sutta (M III 83) the Buddha clearly showed that an object of body contem￾plation, the breath, can be used to contemplate feelings, mind, and dhammas, rather than keeping breath contemplation restricted to the area of body contemplation only.
2.10	Lily de Silva (n.d.): p.6.
2.11	Nett 82 correlates ātāpī with energy (viriya), sampajāna with wisdom (paññā), and vineyya loke abhijjhādomanassa with concentration (samādhi). Paṭis II 15 further expands the correlation with all five faculties.
2.12	Cf. S I 103 and S V 421.
2.13	Basham 1951: p.88.
2.14	Bronkhorst 1993: pp.31–6, and 51.
2.15	At D I 161 and at S IV 330 the Buddha rejected the false report that he was categorically against all austerities. At A V 191 the Buddha explained that he was neither in favour of nor against austerities, since what really mattered was whether any particular aus￾terity or practice led to an increase in either wholesome or unwholesome states of mind.
2.16	At A II 200. Cf. also M I 81, where the Buddha, after listing the ascetic practices he had performed previous to awakening, concluded that these had not led him to realiza￾tion because of the absence of wisdom.
2.17	M II 93.
2.18	The bodhisatta‘s ascetic practices are described in detail at M I 77–81 and at M I 242–6. Mil 285 explains that none of the previous Buddhas ever practised austerities, Gotama being the only case, owing to his immature knowledge at the time.
2.19	Cf. S I 103, where the recently awakened Buddha congratulated himself on having left asceticism behind and having gained awakening through mindfulness instead.
2.20	This can be gathered from his humorous reply to the accusation of being a tapassī himself at Vin I 235; Vin III 3; A IV 175; and A IV 184; where he pointed out that his form of self-mortification was to “mortify” what is unwholesome. Cf. also Collins 1982: p.235; and Horner 1979: p.97.
2.21	D III 106. The association of the awakening factors with “exertion” (padhāna) occurs also at D III 226; A II 16; and A II 74. S I 54 even goes so far as to associate them with “austerity”: bojjhaṅgatapasā (however, Bodhi 2000: p.390 n.168, suggests the reading bojjhā tapasā instead).
2.22	D III 130 speaks of other ascetics accusing the Buddha’s disciples of living a life devoted to indulgence in pleasure. At M I 249 the Buddha faced criticism because he sometimes slept during the day. The same topic comes up again at S I 107, where Māra poked fun at the Buddha for being still asleep at sunrise (after a night spent in walk￾ing meditation), cf. also S I 110. At Vin IV 91 the Buddha was derisively called a “shaven-headed householder” by an Ājīvika ascetic, presumably because of the abundance of food received by Buddhist monks. Cf. further Basham 1951: p.137; and Chakravarti 1996: p.51.
2.23	Compare e.g. Makkhali Gosāla’s view (at D I 53 or at S III 210) that there is no power or energy (to take decisions or influence one’s destiny in any way), a view which the Buddha strongly censured (e.g. at A I 286); or Pûraṇa Kassapa’s view (at D I 52) that there is neither evil nor good. (S III 69 seems to confuse these two teachers, putting Gosāla’s view into Kassapa’s mouth.)
2.24	Cf. e.g. M II 174; Dhp 280; It 27; and Th 1165. Cf. also Pande 1957: p.519; and C.A.F. Rhys Davids 1898: p.50.
2.25	At S V 272, Ānanda countered the proposal that to overcome desire using desire would be a task without end with the argument that the desire for realization will automatically subside once realization is gained. Similarly, according to A II 145 it is on the basis of “craving” (for the destruction of the influxes) that craving (in general) will be overcome. Cf. also Sn 365, where the Buddha spoke approvingly of someone long￾ing to attain Nibbāna. The importance of “desire” as an aspect of the path leading to realization is also exemplified in the canonical presentation of the four roads to power (iddhipāda), one of which is desire (chanda). Cf. also Burford 1994: p.48; Katz 1979: p.58; and Matthews 1975: p.156. A helpful distinction between various types of desire in this context can be found in Collins 1998: pp.186–8.
2.26	A typical instance of such reinterpretation is Dhp 184, where patience is identified as the highest austerity. Cf. also Kloppenborg 1990: p.53.
2.27	A I 50.
2.28	M I 219.
2.29	M I 94. This ability of the Buddha to sit without moving for seven days is also docu￾mented at Vin I 1; Ud 1–3; Ud 10; and Ud 32. Thī 44 and Thī 174 each report the same for a realized nun. It is telling if one contrasts the Buddha’s experience of sitting without moving for seven days experiencing only bliss with a description of sitting “with determination” in Maha Boowa 1997: p.256: “sitting … for many hours … the painful feelings quickly spread to all parts of the body … even the backs of the hands and feet feel as if they are on fire … inside the body it seems as if … bones … are about to break apart and separate … the body … as if it were burning in a mass of flames externally… internally as if it was being beaten by hammers and stabbed with sharp steel dag￾gers … the whole body is in agony.”
2.30	In fact at M I 481 the Buddha used the expression “let my blood dry up” etc. in order to admonish monks who were unwilling to give up eating in the evening. As 146 glosses this expression with “firm and steadfast effort”.
2.31	e.g. at Th 223; Th 313; and Th 514.
2.32	M III 92.
2.33	S V 213.
2.34	Cf. e.g. M III 159, where both are listed as possible obstructions to developing a con￾centrated mind. The need for an intelligent maintenance of balance in meditation practice is also reflected at M II 223, according to which the path to freedom from dukkha at times requires the application of effort, while at other times it just requires equanimous observation.
2.35	Other translations of ātāpī reflect similar shades of meaning, it being variously ren￾dered as “conscientious”, as “active”, or as the input of energy that “revives the decreasing morale” (Hamilton 1996: p.173; Katz 1989: p.155; and Pandey 1988: p.37). The nuance of continuity can be seen at A III 38 and A IV 266, which associate ātāpī with being continuously active. Another relevant instance is at M III 187, where ātāpī occurs in what might refer to spending a night in meditation (following Ñāṇapoṇika 1977: p.346, for bhaddekaratta). Similarly Dhīravaṃsa 1989: p.97, understands ātāpī as “perseverance”; and Ñāṇārāma 1990: p.3, as “unbroken continuity”.
2.36	Vin I 182 and A III 375; (also Th 638–9); and in the satipaṭṭhāna subcommentary, Ps-pṭ I 384, in order to illustrate the need for balanced energy in satipaṭṭhāna contemplation. The need for balance is also stressed by Kor 1985: p.23.
2.37	Khantipālo 1986: p.28; and Vimalaraṃsi 1997: p.49, warn against the dangers of overstraining or forcing meditation and the emotional disturbances and hardening of the mind that may ensue. Mann 1992: p.120, based on comparing the common charac￾ter type in ancient Indian and the typical modern “western” mind, warns against in￾discriminately applying to “hate” type meditators instructions developed mainly for the “craving” type. Cf. also W.S. Karunaratne 1988a: p.70.
2.38	S V 421.
2.39	At S I 1 the Buddha pointed out that by avoiding stagnation and excessive striving he had been able to “cross the flood”. Cf. also Sn 8–13, which similarly recommend nei￾ther going too far nor lagging behind.
2.40	M III 187 and Dhp 276.
2.41	e.g. at S II 21; S III 74–9; S IV 37; S IV 64; S IV 76; and A IV 299. T.W. Rhys Davids 1997: p.242, and Singh 1967: p.127, relate tapas in a secondary sense to retirement into soli￾tude in the forest, which parallels the use of ātāpī together with “dwelling alone and secluded” in the standard description of such a monk’s going into seclusion for inten￾sive practice.
2.42	Jotika 1986: p.29 n.15. This parallels the commentarial understanding of the related term appamāda as undistracted mindfulness,satiyā avippavāso (e.g. Sv I 104 or Dhp-a IV 26).
2.43	T.W. Rhys Davids 1993: pp.655 and 690.
2.44	The Satipaṭṭhāna subcommentary, Ps-pṭ I 354, explains sampajāna as “knowing in ev￾ery way and in detail”. Guenther 1991: p.85, speaks of “analytical appreciative under￾standing”; Ñāṇārāma 1990: p.4, of “investigative intelligence”; and van Zeyst 1967a: p.331, of “deliberate, discriminative knowledge”.
2.45	D III 103 and D III 231.
2.46	M I 286 and M I 414. Furthermore A II 158 distinguishes between the threefold action being done either sampajāna or else asampajāna, a context which also merits rendition as “deliberateness”.

2.50	e.g. Dhs 16 and Vibh 250. Sampajañña is also related to wisdom by Ayya Kheminda (n.d.): p.30; Buddhadāsa 1989: p.98; Debvedi 1990: p.22; Dhammasudhi 1968: p.67; Ñāṇapoṇika 1992: p.46; and Swearer 1967: p.153.
2.51	M I 56: “breathing in long, he knows ‘I breathe in long’”; M I 57: “he knows accord￾ingly however his body is disposed.”
2.52	e.g. M I 61: “he knows the eye, he knows forms, and he knows the fetter that arises de￾pendent on both.”
2.53	M I 62: “he knows as it really is, ‘this is dukkha‘… ‘this is the arising of dukkha‘ … ‘this is the cessation of dukkha‘ …’this is the way leading to the cessation of dukkha.’”
2.54	M I 57: “when going forward and returning he acts clearly knowing; when looking ahead and looking away he acts clearly knowing.…” I will consider this exercise in more detail on page 141.
2.55	e.g. at D I 70.
2.56	Maintaining equanimity towards attentive or non-attentive disciples at M III 221; go￾ing to sleep at M I 249; enduring illness and pain at D II 99; D II 128; S I 27; S I 110; and Ud 82; giving up his life principle at D II 106; S V 262; A IV 311; and Ud 64; lying down to die at D II 137. The presence of both at the time of death is recommended to the monks in general at S IV 211.

2.59	Contemplating feelings and thoughts at A IV 168; (cf. also A II 45); perceptual training at D III 250 and D III 113; and overcoming sloth-and-torpor e.g. at D I 71.
2.60	e.g. at D II 313; cf. also the comment at Vism 163; Guenther 1991: p.124; and Gunaratana 1996: p.92.
2.61	The interaction between sati and wisdom is described at Ps I 243, according to which wisdom contemplates what has become an object of awareness. Cf. also Vibh-a 311, which distinguishes between sati with and without wisdom, showing that wisdom is not an automatic result of the presence ofsati, but needs to be deliberately developed. On the importance of combining sati with sampajañña cf. Chah 1996: p.6; and Mahasi 1981: p.94.
2.62	S III 152 and S V 434.
2.63	I will consider sampajañña again when discussing the practice of mental labelling (page 113) and when investigating clearly knowing in regard to bodily activities as one of the body contemplations (page 141).

3.4	A survey of the sixty-two grounds for formulating views, presented in the Brahmajāla Sutta (D I 12–39), reveals that “direct” meditative experiences are the most frequent cause for formulating a view, while speculative thought assumes only a subordinate role: forty-nine instances appear to be based purely or at least in part on meditative experiences [nos 1–3, 5–7, 9–11, 17, 19–22, 23–5, 27, 29–41, 43–9, 51–7, 59–62]; against only thirteen instances based on pure reasoning [nos 4, 8, 12–16, 18, 26, 28, 42, 50, 58] (corre￾lations made with the help of the commentary). Cf. also Bodhi 1992a: p.6.
3.5	Ud 68.
3.6	Ud 67; cf. also D II 282. Another illustration of such a wrong conclusion can be found at M III 210, where direct supernormal knowledge led to various wrong assumptions about the working mechanism of karma.
3.7	At S IV 139 the Buddha proposed contemplation of the mind in relation to sense expe￾rience as a method of arriving at final knowledge independent of faith, personal pref￾erences, oral tradition, reasoning, and acceptance of a view.
3.8	This brings to mind the threefold distinction between wisdom based on reflecting, on learning, and on mental development (a threefold presentation which in the dis￾courses occurs only at D III 219).
3.9	Cf. Bodhi 1993: p.86; Gethin 1992: p.36; Guenther 1991: p.67; and Ñāṇamoli 1995: p.1188 n.136. The Sanskrit equivalent of sati is smòti, also connoting memory and men￾tal retention, cf. Monier-Williams 1995: p.1271; and C.A.F. Rhys Davids 1978: p.80.
3.10	e.g. sati pamuṭṭhā at M I 329 meaning “forgotten”; or sati udapādi at D I 180 as “remem￾bering”; cf. also A IV 192, which uses the term asati when describing a monk pretend￾ing to have forgotten an offence for which he was being reproved.
3.11	Cf. Dhs 11; Vibh 250; Pp 25; As 121; Mil 77; and Vism 162.
3.12	Vin II 287 reports Ānanda calling to mind and reciting the discourses spoken by the Buddha during the first council. Whether or not this account of the first council corresponds to historical truth, the fact that the Vinaya attributes the recital of the dis￾courses to Ānanda must be reflecting his outstanding powers of memory (to which he himself refers at Th 1024). Ānanda’s eminence in sati comes in for the Buddha’s praise at A I 24. Nevertheless, according to Vin I 298 he also had lapses of sati, such as when he once set out to collect alms forgetting to put on all his robes.
3.13	e.g. at A III 284. On the six recollections cf. also Vism 197–228; and Devendra 1985: pp.25–45.
3.14	A II 183 points out that recollection of past lives is to be undertaken through sati. Simi￾larly A V 336 speaks of directing sati to the Buddha in order to recollect him. Nid II 262 clearly understands all recollections as activities of sati. Vism 197 sums up: “it is through sati that one recollects.”
3.15	Th 217–8. Th-a II 82 explains that based on recollecting the Buddha the monk then developed deep concentration which enabled him to recall past Buddhas, with the result that he realized that even Buddhas are impermanent. This in turn led to his awakening.
3.16	e.g. at M I 356.
3.17	The passage at M I 356 could then be rendered as: “he is mindful, being endowed with highest discriminative mindfulness (so that) things said or done long ago are recalled and remembered.” Ñāṇamoli 1995: p.1252 n.560, explains: “keen attentiveness to the present forms the basis for an accurate memory of the past.” Ñāṇananda 1984: p.28, points out: “mindfulness and memory … the keenness of the one naturally leads to the clarity of the other.”
3.18	Ñāṇapoṇika 1992: p.9; Ñāṇavīra 1987: p.382; and T.W. Rhys Davids 1966: vol.II, p.322. Griffith 1992: p.111, explains: “the basic meaning of smòti and derivatives in Buddhist technical discourse … has to do with observation and attention, not with awareness of past objects.”
3.19	Paṭis I 16; Paṭis I 116; and Vism 510.
3.20	Cf. S I 44, where sati is related to wakefulness. A related nuance occurs at Vism 464, which relates sati to strong cognition (thirasaññā).
3.21	The opposite case is documented at Vin II 261, where a nun failed to memorize the training rules for lack of sati.
3.22	Ñāṇananda 1993: p.47.
3.23	Sn 1053; Sn 1066; and Sn 1085.
3.24	S IV 119. M I 266; S IV 186; S IV 189; and S IV 199 make the same statement in relation to kāyasati. Similarly Sn 150–1 refers to the practice of radiating mettā in all directions as a form of sati, so here too sati represents an “immeasurable” state of mind.
3.25	Piatigorski 1984: p.150. Cf. also Newman 1996: p.28, who distinguishes between two levels of attention, primary and secondary: “I may be thinking about tomorrow and still be aware that now I am thinking about tomorrow … my first level awareness is on tomorrow but my second level awareness is on what is happening now (i.e. that now I am thinking about tomorrow).”
3.26	Definitions of sati as a faculty mention both the practice of satipaṭṭhāna (S V 196 and S V 200) and memory (S V 198), the latter being also the definition of sati as a power (A III 11). As an awakening factor,sati again covers both aspects, since at M III 85 the pres￾ence of undistracted mindfulness as the outcome of satipaṭṭhāna practice forms sati as an awakening factor (the same definition is found several times at S V 331–9); whereas the awakening factor sati functions as memory at S V 67, since here it is concerned with recollecting and considering the teaching.
3.27	M III 73 defines right mindfulness as the presence of awareness when overcoming wrong thought, wrong speech, wrong action, and wrong livelihood, and when estab￾lishing their counterparts.
3.28	This is highlighted in the Paṭisambhidāmagga, according to which a clear appreciation of this difference constitutes “discriminative understanding” (dhammapaṭisambhida-ñāṇa), cf. Paṭis I 88 and Paṭis I 90.
3.29	M III 85; cf also S V 68.
3.30	D II 313: “he abides contemplating the body … feelings … the mind … dhammas, dili￾gent, clearly knowing and mindful, free from desires and discontent in regard to the world – this is called right mindfulness.” An alternative definition of “right mindful￾ness” can be found in the Atthasālinī, which simply speaks of remembering properly (As 124). The definition of right mindfulness in the Chinese Āgamas also does not mention the four satipaṭṭhānas: “he is mindful, widely mindful, keeping in mind, not forgetful, this is called right mindfulness,” (translation by Minh Chau 1991: p.97; cf. also Choong 2000: p.210).
3.31	“Micchā sati” at D II 353; D III 254; D III 287; D III 290; D III 291; M I 42; M I 118; M III 77; M III 140; S II 168; S III 109; S V 1; S V 12; S V 13; S V 16; S V 18–20; S V 23; S V 383; A II 220–9; A III 141; A IV 237; and A V 212–48 (A III 328 also has a wrong form of anussati). This sub￾stantial number of references to “wrong” types of sati to some extent disagrees with the commentarial presentation ofsati as an exclusively wholesome mental factor (e.g. As 250). This presentation of the commentaries causes, in fact, a practical difficulty: how to reconcile sati as a wholesome factor with satipaṭṭhāna in relation to the hin￾drances, if wholesome and unwholesome mental qualities cannot coexist in the same state of mind? The commentaries attempt to resolve this contradiction by presenting satipaṭṭhāna of a defiled state of mind as a quick alternation between mind-moments associated with sati and those under the influence of defilements (e.g. at Ps-pṭ I 373). This explanation is however not convincing, since with either the defilement or else sati being absent, satipaṭṭhāna contemplation of the presence of a defilement in one’s mind becomes impossible (cf. e.g. the instructions for contemplating the hindrances, which clearly refer to such a hindrance being present at the time of satipaṭṭhāna prac￾tice, M I 60: “he knows ‘there is … in me’”). Cf. furthermore Gethin 1992: pp.40–3; and Ñāṇapoṇika 1985: pp.68–72. According to the Sarvāstivāda tradition,sati is an indeter￾minate mental factor, cf. Stcherbatsky 1994: p.101.
3.32	At S I 208 Maṇibhadda proposed: “being mindful one is always blessed, being mind￾ful one dwells happily, being mindful one lives better each day, and one is free from ill-will.” The Buddha then repeated the first three lines, but corrected the fourth line to read: “yet one is not free from ill-will”. Thus the central point in the Buddha’s answer was to emphasize that sati alone might not suffice for eradicating ill will. This does, however, not mean that sati is incapable of preventing the arising of ill will, since its presence goes a long way in helping one to remain calm when confronted with the anger of others, as documented at S I 162; S I 221; S I 222; and S I 223.
3.33	M I 117 speaks in this context of practising mindfulness (sati karaṇīyaṃ), while earlier he had actively to protect the crop by closely watching over the cows (rakkheyya). This, however, does not imply thatsati cannot also take part in holding back a cow about to stray into ripe crops, which in fact it does at Th 446, but only that the more relaxed observation described above brings out a characteristic feature of bare and receptive sati.
3.34	Th 765.
3.35	M III 136.
3.36	M II 260.
3.37	S I 172 and Sn 77. This simile might have suggested itself since with the help of the goad the farmer ensures the continuity of the ploughing, keeping the ox “on track”, while the ploughshare penetrates the surface of the earth, turns up its hidden parts, and thereby prepares it for seeds to be grown and planted. Similarly, continuity ofsati keeps the mind “on track” with regard to the meditation object, so that sati can pene￾trate the surface appearance of phenomena, turn up their hidden aspects (the three characteristics), and enable the seeds of wisdom to grow. The fact that ploughshare and goad are mentioned together in the above simile points moreover to the need to combine clarity of direction with balanced effort in developing sati, since the farmer has to execute two tasks at the same time: with the goad in one hand he has to ensure the straightness of the furrow by keeping the oxen moving in a straight line, while with the other hand he has to exert just the right amount of pressure on the plough￾share, so that it neither gets stuck because he has pushed it too deeply into the ground or only scratches over the surface for lack of pressure.
3.38	Spk I 253 and Pj II 147 explain the import of this simile to be that wisdom understands phenomena only when they are known through sati.
3.39	A III 346. The same imagery occurs again at Th 695; and is at Th 1090 even transferred from an elephant to the Buddha himself.
3.40	M II 137 depicts the Buddha turning his whole body whenever looking back. This “elephant look” of the Buddha is again documented at D II 122; while M I 337 reports the same for the Buddha Kakusandha.
3.41	According to Mil 266, arahants never lose their sati.
3.42	S IV 292. The whole simile originally comes up at Ud 76, where it is only the commen￾tary, Ud-a 370, which relates the single spoke to sati. Though the image of a single spoke might appear strange, as long as this spoke is strong enough (viz. the arahant‘s presence of sati), it is capable of providing the required connection between hub and rim to form a wheel.
3.43	Sn 1035; on this verse cf. also Ñāṇananda 1984: p.29.
3.44	The relation of sati to wisdom is also alluded to at Vism 464, according to which the characteristic function of sati is absence of confusion (asammoharasa).
3.45	S V 6. A variation on the same imagery occurs at S I 33, where the Dhamma itself be￾comes the charioteer, with the consequence thatsati is relegated to being the chariot’s upholstery. The image of sati as upholstery illustrates how established sati in a way “cushions” the practitioner against the impact of the “potholes” of life, since the pres￾ence of awareness counters the tendency towards those mental reactions and prolif￾erations that ordinarily tend to arise in relation to the vicissitudes of life.
3.46	S V 170. I will examine this simile in more detail on page 122.
3.47	S IV 194.
3.48	A IV 110.
3.49	Cf. also Chah 1997: p.10: “that which ‘looks over’ the various factors which arise in meditation is ‘sati’.”
3.50	D III 269 and A V 30.
3.51	A IV 385. Cf. also the similar formulation at A IV 339 and A V 107. Th 359 and 446 also refer to the controlling influence of sati on the mind.
3.52	A V 352.
3.53	M I 221.
3.54	S V 148, where the Buddha related a parable in which a monkey was caught by a hunter because he had left the jungle (his “pasture”) and entered a region visited by men. The need to keep to one’s proper pasture comes up again at S V 146 in a parallel simile depicting a quail which in this way can avoid getting caught by a falcon.
3.55	S V 149. However, the commentaries to M I 221 and A V 352 (Ps II 262 and Mp V 95) explain lack of skill in “pasture” to imply lack of understanding the difference between mundane and supramundane satipaṭṭhāna.
3.56	S IV 198. Since this simile is concerned with mindfulness of the body in particular, I will discuss it in more detail on page 123.
3.57	M I 462. In fact at D II 141 the Buddha particularly emphasized the need to keep to sati for monks who were coming in contact with women.
3.58	At It 33 the Buddha distinguished between two successive aspects of his teaching, the first of which was to recognize evil as evil, while the second was to get free from such evil.
3.59	An example for the coexistence of sati with intense effort is furnished by the bodhi￾satta‘s ascetic practices (at M I 242), where even during excessive striving he was able to maintain his mindfulness.
3.60	Lily de Silva (n.d.): p.5; Fraile 1993: p.99; Naeb 1993: p.158; Swearer 1971: p.107; and van Zeyst 1989: pp.9 and 12. This receptive and not interfering quality ofsati is also echoed at Nid II 262, which relates sati to peacefulness.
3.61	The expression “choiceless awareness” is used by Brown 1986b: p.167; Engler 1983: p.32; Epstein 1984: p.196; Goldstein 1985: p.19; Kornfield 1977: p.12; Levine 1989: p.28; and Sujīva 2000: p.102.
3.62	Dhīramvaṃsa 1988: p.31.
3.63	This is to some extent paralleled at A I 295, which presents satipaṭṭhāna as a middle path, aloof from both indulgence in sensuality and self-mortification.
3.64	Cf. Festinger 1957: p.134.
3.65	D I 19 and D III 31.
3.66	D II 272.
3.67	Abhidh-s 7. The discourses assign a similarly important role to attention (manasikāra) by including it in the definition of “name” (nāma), e.g. at M I 53. On the relation of sati to attention cf. Bullen 1991: p.17; Gunaratana 1992: p.150; and Ñāṇapoṇika 1950: p.3.
3.68	Ñāṇapoṇika 1986b: p.2. This “bare” quality ofsati is alluded to at Vism 464, which con￾siders being directly face-to-face with an object as a characteristic manifestation of sati.
3.69	Wise attention (yoniso manasikāra) is applied to antidotes for the hindrances at S V 105, can lead to realization by giving attention to the impermanent nature of the aggre￾gates at S III 52 and of the sense-spheres at S IV 142, establishes the awakening factors at S V 94, and consists in contemplating the four noble truths at M I 9. Cf. also A V 115, where wise attention functions as “nutriment” for mindfulness and clear knowledge, which in turn act as nutriment for satipaṭṭhāna.
3.70	Deikman 1966: p.329; Engler 1983: p.59; Goleman 1980: p.27; and 1975: p.46; and van Nuys 1971: p.127.
3.71	The standard definition of sense-restraint, found e.g. at M I 273, speaks of avoiding being carried away by one’s evaluations and reactions to what is perceived through the senses. Cf. also Debvedi 1998: p.18; and page 225 infra.
3.72	M I 56: “free from desires and discontent in regard to the world.”
3.73	 Modern scholars and meditation teachers offer several alternative summaries of the essential aspects of sati.  Ayya Khema 1991: p.182, distinguishes two applications of sati: the mundane application, helping one to be aware of what one is doing, and the supramundane application of penetrating to the real nature of things.  Dhammasudhi 1969: p.77, describes four aspects ofsati: awareness of surroundings, of one’s reactions to these surroundings, of one’s own conditioning, and of stillness (“pure awareness”). Hecker 1999: p.11, mentions vigilance, self-control, depth, and steadiness. Ñāṇa￾poṇika 1986b: p.5, enumerates four “sources of power” in sati: tidying up by naming, non-coercive procedure, stopping and slowing down, and directness of vision.
3.74	M III 25–8 documents that this need applies to each stage in the ascending series of meditative absorptions, since it lists sati among the mental factors of the four absorp￾tions of the form sphere and of the first three immaterial attainments. The fourth im￾material attainment and the attainment of cessation, both being states of mind not amenable to factor analysis, are still related to sati on emergence (M III 28). Presence of sati in all jhānas is also documented at Dhs 55 and at Paṭis I 35.
3.75	Vism 514.
3.76	Described e.g. at M III 25.
3.77	Cf. D III 279; Paṭis II 16; and Vism 129.
3.78	The standard descriptions of the third jhāna (e.g. at D II 313) explicitly mention the presence of sati and of clearly knowing.
3.79	The standard descriptions of the fourth jhāna (e.g. at D II 313) speak of “purity of mindfulness due to equanimity”, which then can be used to develop supernatural powers (e.g. at M I 357). That here sati is indeed purified by the presence of equanim￾ity can be gathered from M III 26 and Vibh 261; cf. also As 178 and Vism 167.
3.80	The concentrative attainments possible through satipaṭṭhāna practice are documented on several occasions, such as D II 216; S V 151; S V 299; S V 303; and A IV 300. According to Ledi 1985: p.59, one should embark on the development of absorption only when one is able to maintain satipaṭṭhāna contemplation uninterruptedly for one or two hours daily.
3.81	M III 136. Whereas the pts edition speaks of thoughts in relation to the objects of satipaṭṭhāna (kāyûpasaṃhitaṃ vitakkaṃ etc.), the Burmese and the Sinhalese editions speak of sensual thoughts instead (kāmûpasaṃhitaṃ vitakkaṃ). Judging from the dy￾namics of the discourse, this seems to be the less probable reading, since this passage follows on the removal of the five hindrances and leads on to absorption, and that straightaway into the second jhāna. The corresponding Chinese version (T’iao Yü Ti Ching, Madhyama Āgama no. 198), however, supports the reading of the Burmese and Sinhalese editions. In addition, it also mentions the attainment of the first jhāna, which in all the Pāli editions is missing.
3.82	M I 301. Ps II 363 takes this to refer to the moment of realization, which, however, as the commentary also admits, is difficult to reconcile with the fact that the discourse speaks of developing and making much of this samādhinimitta.  The supportive role of satipaṭṭhāna for the development of right concentration is also echoed at A V 212, according to which right mindfulness gives rise to right concentration.
3.83	A I 23.
3.84	S V 294–306; cf. also Malalasekera 1995: vol.I, p.88.
3.85	Cf. e.g. Schmithausen 1973: p.179, who suggests thatsatipaṭṭhāna was originally purely a concentration exercise.
3.86	Cf. also Bullen 1982: p.44; Delmonte 1991: pp.48–50; Goleman 1977a: p.298; Shapiro 1980: pp.15–19; and Speeth 1982: pp.146 and 151. Gunaratana 1992: p.165, aptly sums up: “concentration is exclusive. It settles down on one item and ignores everything else. Mindfulness is inclusive. It stands back from the focus of attention and watches with a broad focus.”
3.87	Brown 1977: p.243: “two major cortical control mechanisms … involved in selecting and processing information … a frontal system associated with restrictive processing and a posterior-temporal system associated with more wide-range processing of in￾formation. The brain may be likened to a camera that can use either a wide-angle lens or a zoom lens. Or, in cognitive terms, attention can be directed to the more dominant details in a stimulus field or to the entire field.”
3.88	S V 156.
3.89	At the beginning of this passage the Buddha spoke in praise of being well established in the four satipaṭṭhānas. Thus the reason for his exposition about “directed” and “undirected” modes of meditation appears to be that he wanted to show how samatha can act as a support for the practice of satipaṭṭhāna.
3.90	Kamalashila 1994: p.96; Kyaw Min 1980: p.96; and Ruth Walshe 1971: p.104. Cf. also page 262.
3.91	Cf. Brown 1986b: p.180, who in a comparison of Rorschach tests done with different meditators describes in his conclusion the “unproductivity and relative paucity of associative process which characterizes the samādhi state”, while “the Rorschachs of the insight group … are primarily characterized by increased productivity and rich￾ness of associative elaborations.”
3.92	Mahasi 1990: p.23: “the knowing mind … as in the case of a stone hitting a wall”; which Sīlananda 1990: p.21, identifies: “like the stone hitting the wall … that hitting of the object is mindfulness”. Paṇḍita (n.d.): p.6, goes further, when he describes satipaṭṭhāna as implying to “attack the object without hesitation … with violence, speed or great force … with excessive haste or hurry”, which he then compares to sol￾diers defeating an enemy troop in a sudden attack.
3.93	Such more advanced stages of satipaṭṭhāna practice are sometimes referred to as “vipassanā jhānas”, an expression not found in the discourses, the Abhidhamma, or the commentaries. Cf. Mahasi 1981: p.98; and a detailed exposition in Paṇḍita 1993: pp.180–205, cf. esp. p.199: “non-thinking, bare attention is called the second vipassanā jhāna”.
3.94	This is the term apilāpanatā, found at Dhs 11 (detailed expo at As 147); Vibh 250; Pp 25; Nett 54; Mil 37; and Vism 464. On the term cf. also Guenther 1991: p.68 n.2; Horner 1969: p.50 n.5; Ñāṇamoli 1962: p.28 n.83/3; and C.A.F. Rhys Davids 1922: p.14 n.3.
3.95	Gethin 1992: pp.38–40, suggests that the commentarial reading of apilāpeti should rather be apilapati (or abhilapati), which instead of describing sati as “plunging into”, would come to mean “reminding someone of something”. Cf. also Cox 1992: pp.79–82.
4.1	M I 56. A IV 430 explains “world” as referring to the pleasures of the five senses. This squares well with A IV 458, where satipaṭṭhāna leads to their abandoning. Vibh 195 takes “world” in the satipaṭṭhāna context to represent the five aggregates.

4.6	Generally speaking, the form vineyya can be either a gerund: “having removed” (this is how the commentary understands it, cf. Ps I 244: vinayitvā), or else 3rd sing. poten￾tial: “one should remove” (as e.g. at Sn 590; cf. also Woodward 1980: vol.IV, p.142 n.3). However, in the present context to take vineyya as a potential form is not acceptable, as then the sentence would have two finite verbs in different moods (viharati + vineyya). Usually the gerund form does imply an action preceding the action of the main verb, which in the present case would mean that the removal has to be com￾pleted prior to the practice of satipaṭṭhāna. However, in some cases the gerund can also represent an action occurring concurrently with the action denoted by the main verb. An example of a concurrent action expressed by the gerund is the standard description of the practice of loving kindness in the discourses (e.g. at M I 38) where the “abiding” (viharati) and the “pervading” (pharitvā) are simultaneous activities, to￾gether describing the act of radiating loving kindness. The same type of construction occurs in relation to the attainment of absorption (e.g. at D I 37), where the “abiding” (viharati) and the “attaining” (upasampajja) also take place simultaneously. In fact, sev￾eral translators have rendered vineyya in such a way that it represents the outcome of satipaṭṭhāna practice. Cf. e.g. Dhammiko 1961: p.182: “um weltliches Begehren und Bekümmern zu überwinden”; Gethin 1992: p.29: “he … overcomes both desire for and discontent with the world”; Hamilton 1996: p.173: “in order to remove [himself] from the covetousness and misery in the world”; Hare 1955: vol.IV, p.199: “overcom￾ing the hankering and dejection common in this world”; Hurvitz 1978: p.212: “putting off envy and ill disposition toward the world”; Jotika 1986: p.1: “keeping away covet￾ousness and mental pain”; Lamotte 1970: p.1122: “au point de controler dans le monde la convoitise et la tristesse”; Lin Li Kouang 1949: p.119: “qu’il surmonte le déplaisir que la convoitise cause dans le monde”; C.A.F. Rhys Davids 1978: p.257: “overcoming both the hankering and the dejection common in the world”; Schmidt 1989: p.38: “alle weltlichen Wünsche und Sorgen vergessend”; Sīlananda 1990: p.177: “removing cov￾etousness and grief in the world”; Solé-Leris 1999: p.116: “desechando la codicia y la aflicción de lo mundano”; Talamo 1998: p.556: “rimovendo bramosia e malcontento riguardo al mondo”; Ṭhānissaro 1996: p.83: “putting aside greed and distress with ref￾erence to the world”; Woodward 1979: vol.V, p.261: “restraining the dejection in the world that arises from coveting”.

4.10	This would however only apply for the preliminary stages of practice, since for the first three satipaṭṭhānas to lead to awakening, freedom from desire and discontent is a requirement, indicated at M III 86 by qualifying the arising of the awakening factor of equanimity in relation to each of the four satipaṭṭhānas with the same expression as the one used at M III 84 in relation to the final four steps of mindfulness of breathing.
4.11	M I 55: “this is the direct path … for the disappearance of … discontent … namely, the four satipaṭṭhānas.”
4.12	Ps I 244 understands a successful removal of desires and discontent to be an outcome of the practice. Cf. also Debvedi 1990: p.22; Khemacari 1985: p.18; Ñāṇasaṃvara 1961: p.8, Ñāṇuttara 1990: p.280; and Yubodh 1985: p.9.
4.13	Ps I 244.
4.14	At D I 72; D I 207; D III 49; M I 181; M I 269; M I 274; M I 347; M II 162; M II 226; M III 3;M III 35; M III 135; A II 210; A III 92; A III 100; A IV 437; A V 207; and It 118. In its general usage in the discourses, abhijjhā represents one of the ten unwholesome ways of act￾ing (e.g. at D III 269). In this context it means covetousness, in the sense of the wish to own the possessions of others (cf. e.g. M I 287). Cf. also van Zeyst 1961b: p.91.
4.15	D II 306 defines domanassa as mental pain and unpleasantness. M III 218 then distin￾guishes between the types of domanassa owing to sensual discontent and those owing to spiritual dissatisfaction. According to M I 304, these latter types of domanassa are not at all related to the underlying tendency to irritation.
4.16	It is a typical tendency of the commentaries to associate a key term (in the present context abhijjhā) with a whole set or standard category as part of their attempt to clarify the teachings, but at times this is done without sufficient consideration of the context.
4.17	The standard definition, e.g. at M I 273, speaks of guarding the sense doors in order to avoid the flowing in of desires and discontent.
4.18	e.g. at D II 83; D III 101; M I 339; S III 93; S V 154; S V 160; S V 184; S V 301; S V 302; A III 155; A III 386; and A V 195. Of particular interest in this context is S III 93, which states that during this advanced level of well-established satipaṭṭhāna practice unwholesome thoughts will no longer be able to arise.
4.19	Cf. e.g. A V 114, where satipaṭṭhāna depends on sense-restraint, which in turn depends on mindfulness and clear knowledge (one of the body contemplations). This suggests some degree of interrelation between sense-restraint and satipaṭṭhāna in actual prac￾tice, rather than a one-sided dependency of the former on the latter.
4.20	e.g. at Vin IV 115.
4.21	At M I 301 samādhi is defined as unification of the mind (cittassekaggatā).
4.22	A III 30 speaks of samādhi gained through walking meditation. Although walking meditation can be employed to develop mental calm, it would not be the appropriate posture for deeper states of concentration. A II 45 refers to contemplating the arising and disappearance of feelings, cognitions, and thoughts, and to contemplating the impermanent nature of the five aggregates, as forms of samādhi. This breadth of meaning of samādhi is also documented at D III 222, which speaks of four different ways of developing samādhi, distinguished according to their results: samādhi leading to pleasant abiding (the jhānas), to knowledge and vision (through development of clarity of cognition), to mindfulness and clear knowledge (by contemplating the aris￾ing and passing away of feelings, cognitions, and thoughts), and to the destruction of the influxes (by contemplating the arising and passing away of the five aggregates).
4.23	A IV 300.
4.24	e.g. at D II 313: “he enters upon and remains in the first jhāna … the second jhāna … the third jhāna … the fourth jhāna … this is called right concentration.”
4.25	A IV 422 speaks of realizing the destruction of the influxes based on the first jhāna; cf. also M I 350; M I 435; and A V 343.
4.26	All fourjhānas are needed only for the approach to realization by way of the threefold higher knowledge (tevijjā), cf. e.g. M I 357. In fact S I 191 reports that, of a substantial congregation of arahants, two out of each three had neither the threefold higher knowledge (tevijjā), nor supernormal knowledges (abhiññā) nor immaterial attain￾ments. If all arahants possessed the ability to attain the fourth jhāna, one would expect a much higher percentage of them to have used this in order to develop one or the other of these attainments. However, Perera 1968: p.210, considers attainment of all four jhānas a necessary condition for awakening.
4.27	D II 217; M III 71; and S V 21. Cf. also D III 252 and A IV 40. Other ways of defining right concentration can also be found at e.g. M III 289, where a penetrative understanding of the six senses constitutes right concentration; or at S I 48, where rightly concentrat￾ing is a result of establishing sati; or at A III 27, which lists what is probably a form of insight meditation as an alternative way to develop right concentration.
4.28	M III 71: “monks, I will teach you noble right concentration.”
4.29	M III 71: “right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, and right mindfulness. Unification of the mind equipped with these seven fac￾tors is called noble right concentration.” Judging from other discourses, to speak of “unification of the mind” need not necessarily imply absorption attainment, since e.g. A II 14 relates unification of the mind to walking and standing, or at A III 174 unifica￾tion of the mind occurs while listening to the Dhamma.
4.30	Cf. also Ba Khin 1994: p.69: “right concentration cannot be achieved unless there is right effort and right mindfulness”; Buddhadāsa 1976: p.36: “’a wholesome mind steadily fixed on an object’ … the term ‘wholesome’ is much more important than ‘steadily fixed’ … the motives for practising concentration must be pure … must be based on insight and right view”; and Weeraratne 1990: p.45: “right concentration … is the one pointedness of mind achieved through cultivating the preceding seven stages of the path,” (as a translation of M III 71).
4.31	Vibh 107 defines right concentration simply as “steadfastness of the mind” (in the Abhidhamma exposition; the Suttanta exposition at Vibh 106, however, enumerates the four jhānas). Vism 510 also defines right concentration as “unification of the mind”.
4.32	A III 423 points out that without purifying view it is not possible to develop right con￾centration.
4.33	Cf. M I 164 for the bodhisatta‘s encounters with Āíāra Kālāma and Uddaka Rāmaputta.
4.34	Cf. Monier-Williams 1995: p.1181, who translates the corresponding Sanskrit term samyak with “complete”, “entire”, and “whole”. T.W. Rhys Davids 1993: p.655, has “to￾wards one point”. Cf. also Gruber 1999: p.190, who comments on the inappropriate￾ness of translating sammā as “right”.
4.35	The relation between these two words appears on several occasions, e.g. at D II 239; D II 265; M I 243; Dhp 372; Sn 1009; and Thī 401.
4.36	M III 14 speaks of being under the influence of the five hindrances as a type of jhāna of which the Buddha did not approve. Another example is the injunction “not to neglect jhāna” (anirākatajjhāna), which at M I 33 and It 39 occurs together with “being devoted to mental calm” and “being endowed with insight”, probably including both in the general sense of “meditation”. Similarly, the frequent exhortation jhāyatha bhikkhave (e.g. at M I 46) is better rendered “meditate monks” than “attain absorption monks”. Another example is the expression “not lacking jhāna” (arittajjhāno), which at A I 39–43 is combined with several meditation practices that do not in themselves yield absorp￾tion attainment, such as satipaṭṭhāna, contemplation of impermanence, or the six rec￾ollections. The most common use of jhāna in the discourses, however, refers to absorption, this kind of usage being easily recognizable by the circumstance that absorption jhāna is usually classified as “first”, “second”, etc. (except for A V 133, where “jhāna” is at first used unspecified, but at the conclusion of the discourse this jhāna is shown to be the first level of absorption).
4.37	The standard definitions, e.g. at D I 73, speak of the first jhāna as “with initial and sus￾tained mental application” (savitakkaṃ savicāraṃ). Several discourses also mention a level of absorption without initial but with sustained mental application (D III 219; D III 274; M III 162; S IV 360; S IV 363; and A IV 300). The resulting fivefold form of pre￾senting the four jhānas became more prominent in the Abhidhamma (explained in detail at As 179). Stuart-Fox 1989: p.92, points out that some of the above quoted occur￾rences are missing from the corresponding Chinese editions.
4.38	Barnes 1981: p.257; Bucknell 1993: p.397; Kalupahana 1994: p.35; Ott 1912: p.348; and Stuart-Fox 1989: p.94.
4.39	M II 28 associates the second jhāna with the cessation of “wholesome intentions”, while S II 273 speaks of the second jhāna as “noble silence”; the same expression occurs also at Th 650 and 999. (Commentary Th-a II 274 identifies this as second jhāna, but Th-a III 102 even speaks of the fourth jhāna.)
4.40	Cf. e.g. Vism 125 on the development of the counterpart sign; and Vism 285 on the development of absorption based on the concentrative sign gained through in- and out-breathing.
4.41	M III 162, where only after having consecutively overcome a whole series of mental obstructions (cf. in detail page 199, footnote 73) he was able to attain the first jhāna. Cf. also A IV 439, which reports his struggle to overcome sensuality in order to be able to develop jhāna.
4.42	M I 246. Possibly his ability to enter the first jhāna so easily at this particular moment during his early youth was related to samatha practice undertaken in a previous life, an ability lost during his adolescence and later sensual indulgence as a young man, so that he had to develop it anew.
4.43	S IV 263.
4.44	Cf. A I 23.
4.45	S IV 217; same at S IV 220–3. Kv 200 uses this passage to oppose the (wrong) view that the jhāna factors initial and sustained mental application refer to vocal activity. This view arose because of their definition as verbal formations at M I 301.
4.46	A V 135. According to Brahmavaṃso 1999: p.29, “while in any jhāna it is impossible to … hear a sound from outside or produce any thought.” Kv 572 also refutes the view that it is possible to hear sound during jhāna attainment. At Vin III 109, some monks accused Moggallāna to have falsely claimed attainment, because he had stated that while being in the “imperturbable concentration” (i.e. fourth jhāna or an immaterial attainment) he had heard sounds. The fact that this led the monks to accuse him of false claims shows that the impossibility of hearing sound during deep absorption was generally accepted among the monks. However, the Buddha exonerated Moggallāna, explaining that it was possible to hear sound even during such a deep level of jhāna, if the attainment was impure (aparisuddho). Sp II 513 explains that be￾cause he had not fully overcome the obstructions to absorption, Moggallāna’s attain￾ment was not stable and thus the hearing took place in a moment of instability of the concentration.
4.47	A IV 430 refers to a monk having attained the first jhāna as having reached the end of the world (“world” being identified with the five sense-pleasures in the same dis￾course). Another example of the distinct character of the jhānic experience is the kind of cognition operating during the first jhāna, which D I 182 calls a “subtle but real” cog￾nition (sukhumasaccasaññā). This expression indicates the attenuated form of cogni￾tion that takes place during absorption, different from the way in which the ordinary world is cognized.
4.48	These are the elements of materiality and immateriality (D III 215), corresponding to the material and immaterial realms of existence (S V 56), and different from the ele￾ment of sensuality or the sensual realm.
4.49	M I 521.
4.50	M I 159 and M I 174.
4.51	M III 73.
4.52	“Application of the mind” (cetaso abhiniropanā) occurs at Vibh 257 and at Vism 142 in a definition of vitakka. Similar understandings of vitakka can be found in Ayya Khema 1991: p.115; Bodhi 2000: p.52, and 1993: p.82; Chah 1992: p.53; Cousins 1992: p.153; Eden 1984: p.89; Goenka 1999: p.93; Ledi 1986a: p.52; Pa Auk 1999: p.17; C.A.F. Rhys Davids 1922: p.8 n.1; Shwe 1979: p.238 n.1; Stcherbatsky 1994: p.104; and Sujīva 1996: p.10.
4.53	Indicated in the standard descriptions of the second jhāna (e.g. at D I 74) by qualifying the joy and happiness experienced to be “born of concentration” (samādhija), and by the expression “singleness of mind” (cetaso ekodibhāva).
4.54	e.g. at S IV 80.
4.55	A III 426 points out that without samādhi it is impossible to gain realization.
4.56	A III 19; A III 200; A III 360; A IV 99; A IV 336; A V 4–6; and A V 314 explain that without right concentration it is not possible to gain liberation. A III 423 stresses again that right concentration is required to be able to eradicate the fetters and realize Nibbāna. It is interesting to note that in most of these cases the absence of right concentration is due to a lack of ethical conduct, so that in the reverse case (cf. e.g. A III 20) one gets a statement indicating that the “rightness” of concentration is the outcome of ethical conduct (viz. factors three, four, and five of the noble eightfold path). This brings to mind the alternative definition discussed above of right concentration as unification of the mind in interrelation with the other path factors. (This is further supported by the use of the Pāli word upanisā in the instances under discussion at present, which echoes the expression sa-upanisā used in the definition of right concentration as unifi￾cation of the mind at M III 71.)
4.57	The distinction drawn here is concerned with what the commentaries refer to as “supramundane” and as “mundane” concentration (cf. the definition given at Vism 85).
4.58	S V 410 lists the need to associate with worthy men, to listen to the Dhamma, to develop wise attention (yoniso manasikāra), and to undertake practice in accordance with the Dhamma as requirements for the realization of stream-entry. (S II 18 explains practice in accordance with the Dhamma to refer in particular to overcoming igno￾rance through developing dispassion.) On requirements for stream-entry cf. also M I 323.
4.59	One would expect this ability to be mentioned among the four characteristic qualities of a stream-enterer, which however are confined to perfect confidence in the Buddha, Dhamma, and Saṅgha, together with firm ethical conduct. At S V 357 the Buddha mentioned these four as defining characteristics of a stream-enterer.
4.60	e.g. A III 63. Cf. also M I 323, which mentions several qualities needed for stream￾entry, among them not being obsessed by the hindrances.
4.61	It 118.
4.62	S V 95.
4.63	D I 110 and D I 148 feature rich Brahmins, whose busy lifestyle as administrators of a royal domain would not be particularly conducive to the development of jhāna, yet each of them realized stream-entry while hearing a discourse of the Buddha. M I 380 and A IV 186 report the stream-entries of stout followers of the Jains during a dis￾course of the Buddha. (Considering that the leader of the Jains, according to S IV 298, even doubted the existence of the second jhāna, one may well suppose that jhānic abil￾ities are improbable in the case of his followers. This impression is borne out by the ac￾count given in Tatia 1951: pp.281–93.) At A IV 213 a drunken layman, sobered up through the impact of meeting the Buddha for the first time, realized stream-entry during a gradual discourse given at that same first meeting. Ud 49 has a leper, described as a poor, pitiable, and wretched person, similarly realizing stream-entry during a discourse of the Buddha. This leper had actually mistaken the crowd listen￾ing to the Buddha for a free distribution of food and had only approached in hope of getting a meal. Finally, according to Vin II 192, several hired killers, one of whom even had the mission of killing the Buddha, all became stream-enterers instead of complet￾ing their mission after hearing a gradual discourse by the Buddha. In all these cases it is not very probable that those realizing stream-entry were involved in the regular practice of meditation or in the possession of jhānic attainments.
4.64	All above quoted instances explicitly mention the mind being free from the hin￾drances.
4.65	Cf. Visuddhacara 1996: who gives a convenient overview of statements by several well-known meditation teachers on the issue.
4.66	e.g. at M I 226. The fact that once-returners do return to “this world” is documented e.g. at A III 348 and A V 138, where once-returners are reborn in the Tusita heaven, a lower celestial realm of the sensual sphere, far inferior to those planes of existence corresponding to absorption attainment. Similarly, according to A IV 380 the more ad￾vanced types of stream-enterers will be reborn as human beings, a level of rebirth even further removed from the planes of existence gained through absorption abilities.
4.67	According to A II 126, one who has developed the first jhāna will be reborn in the Brahmā world. A worldling (puthujjana) will then after some time be reborn in lower realms again, while a noble one (ariya) will proceed from there to final Nibbāna. (This passage refers not only to someone who is absorbed in the actual attainment at the time of death, but to anyone who possesses the ability to attain jhāna.) A similar pas￾sage can be found at A I 267 concerning immaterial attainments and rebirth, and at A II 129 regarding the divine abodes and rebirth.
4.68	According to A IV 380 the once-returner, in contrast to the non-returner, has not per￾fected/completed samādhi. A similar passage can be found at A I 232 and 233. Cf. also Dhammavuddho 1994: p.29; and Ñāṇavīra 1987: p.372.
4.69	e.g. M I 350 and A V 343 describe how a monk, based on attainment of the first or a higher jhāna, is able to reach the destruction of the influxes or non-returning. More explicit is M I 434–5, which clearly stipulates the attainment of jhāna as a necessity for the two higher stages of awakening. Similarly M I 356 and A IV 422 mention jhānic abilities as a necessary condition for gaining non-returning or full awakening.
4.70	At A II 128 the insightful contemplation of absorption leads to non-returning (rebirth in the Suddhāvāsa heaven). Compare also M I 91 where Mahānāma, who according to the commentary (Ps II 61) was a once-returner, was advised by the Buddha to de￾velop jhāna for further progress on the path.
4.71	M I 62: “if anyone should develop these foursatipaṭṭhānas … one of two fruits could be expected for him: either final knowledge here and now, or, if there is a trace of cling￾ing left, non-returning.”
4.72	M I 434 states that there is a path of practice which needs be undertaken in order to be able to overcome the five lower fetters, and this path of practice is jhāna attainment.
4.73	S V 129–33.
4.74	In the Madhyama Āgama as part of the body contemplations, and in the Ekottara Āgama as part of the contemplations of dhammas(in Minh Chau 1991: pp.89 and 90; and Nhat Hanh 1990: p.154 and 176).
4.75	M I 149. This particular “path” scheme forms the underlying structure of the Visuddhimagga. It has been compared to other religious traditions by Brown (1986a) who relates it to path descriptions in the Mahāmudra and the Yoga Sûtras, and by Cousins (1989) who compares it to St Teresa’s “Interior Castle”. Concerning this path scheme it may be worthwhile to point out that, even though it has a normative role for the commentaries and most modern vipassanā schools, this set of seven puri￾fications occurs only once again in the discourses, at D III 288, where it forms part of a nine-stage scheme. This passage does not fit too well with Buddhaghosa’s presenta￾tion of the seven-stage model, since it adds two additional stages at the end of a pro￾gression of stages where, according to Buddhaghosa, with the seventh stage the peak of purification has already been reached (cf. Vism 672). Judging from its usage at M I 195 and M I 203, the term used for the seventh purification, “knowledge and vision”, is indeed only a stage leading up to, but not yet identical with, realization. This impres￾sion is confirmed by the Rathavinīta Sutta itself, which qualifies the purification by “knowledge and vision” as “with clinging” and therefore as falling short of the final goal (M I 148). Thus it seems as if Buddhaghosa’s interpretation of the seventh stage of purification were to some degree at variance with the implications of the same term in the discourses.
4.76	Possibly based on A II 195, where purity of mind is related to attaining the four jhānas. The ability to attain absorption as a necessary basis for realization is maintained by e.g. Kheminda 1980: p.14.
4.77	Cf. e.g. M I 197 and M I 204.

4.82	A II 157; cf. also Tatia 1992: p.89.
4.83	e.g. D III 131; M I 454; or S V 308. The importance given to absorption in early Buddh￾ism is documented by Griffith 1983: p.57, and C.A.F. Rhys Davids 1927a: p.696, both giving an overview of occurrences of the term jhāna in the Pāli Nikāyas.
4.84	A IV 34.
4.85	M I 463 explains that the mind of one who has had jhānic experiences will no longer be overwhelmed by the hindrances. On the other hand, it needs to be pointed out that if sensual desire or aversion should nevertheless manage to invade the mind, they can manifest with surprising vehemence, owing to the increased ability of the mind to re￾main undistractedly with a single object, even an unwholesome one. Examples of this can be found in several Jātaka tales (e.g. no. 66 at Ja I 305, no. 251 at Ja II 271, and no. 431 at Ja III 496), which report previous lives of the bodhisatta as an ascetic. In spite of be￾ing able to attain deep levels of concentration and possessed of supernormal powers, in each case this ascetic was nevertheless completely overwhelmed by sensual desire on unexpectedly seeing a sparsely-dressed woman.
4.86	This is the standard qualification of the mental condition on emerging from the fourth jhāna (e.g. at D I 75).
4.87	At M I 504 the Buddha related his lack of interest in sensual pleasures to his ability to experience far superior types of pleasure; cf. also A III 207 and A IV 411. A I 61 explains that the purpose of samatha is to overcome lust. Conze 1960: p.110, explains: “it is the inevitable result of the habitual practice of trance that the things of our common￾sense world appear delusive, deceptive, remote, and dreamlike.” Cf. also Debes 1994: pp.164–8; and van Zeyst 1970: p.39.
4.88	M I 91.
4.89	M I 92; cf. also S IV 97 and A IV 439. A IV 56 stresses the importance of overcoming sen￾sual desires for him to have been able to gain realization. The Buddha’s attainment of absorption might have taken place based on mindfulness of breathing, which accord￾ing to S V 317 he practised frequently in the time before his awakening. His gradual progress through the various levels of absorption is described at M III 162 and A IV 440, clearly showing that by then he no longer had access to the jhānic experience of his early youth. His encounter with Āíāra Kālāma and Uddaka Rāmaputta would have to be placed after this gradual progress, since without having developed the four jhānas he would not have been able to reach any of the immaterial attainments. (The need for this is documented at D III 265, where the fourjhānas precede the imma￾terial attainments in a sequence of successive stages of development.) Ps IV 209, how￾ever, assumes that the Buddha developed the four jhānas only during the first watch of the night of his awakening. This makes little sense in view of the fact that his pre-awakening development of samatha included also the practice of the “roads to power” (the iddhipādas, cf. A III 82) and developing the concentrative ability to know various aspects of the deva realms (A IV 302), in addition to attaining the four jhānas after overcoming a whole set of mental obstructions (M III 157; cf. also A IV 440, which clearly shows that he had to overcome various obstacles in order to gain each jhāna) and also gaining the four immaterial attainments (A IV 444). The broad range and gradual progression of the Buddha’s development of samatha does not fit well into a single night.
4.90	According to Alexander 1931: p.139, “the absorption scale corresponds to the chrono￾logical path of a well-conducted analysis.” Cf. also Conze 1956: p.20.
4.91	Ayya Khema 1991: p.140; and Epstein 1986: pp.150–5.
4.92	Engler 1986: p.17, aptly sums up the need for a well integrated personality as a basis for developing insight meditation: “you have to be somebody before you can be no￾body.” Epstein 1995: p.133, (commenting on the insight knowledges) explains: “expe￾riences such as these require an ego, in the psychoanalytic sense, that is capable of holding and integrating what would ordinarily be violently destabilizing. One is challenged to experience terror without fear and delight without attachment. The work of meditation, in one sense, is the work of developing an ego that is flexible, clear and balanced enough to enable one to have such experiences.” The supportive role of non-sensual inner happiness in case of hardship is documented at Th 351 and Th 436.
4.93	A IV 123.
4.94	A II 31. Cf. also S II 225, where lack of respect for the development of concentration is one of the causes of the disappearance of the true Dhamma. According to Thate 1996: p.93: “those who think that samādhi is not necessary are the ones who have not yet reached samādhi. That’s why they cannot see the merit of samādhi. Those who have attained samādhi will never speak against it.”
4.95	At A II 165 the Buddha compared attachment to the gratification and bliss experi￾enced during absorption to grasping a branch full of resin, because owing to such at￾tachment one will lose the inspiration to aim at the complete giving up of all aspects of one’s personality and experience. At M I 194 the Buddha then illustrated such at￾tachment using the example of someone who took the inner bark of a tree in mistake for the heartwood he was searching for. Cf. also M III 226, which refers to such attach￾ment to jhāna experiences as “getting stuck internally”. Buddhadāsa 1993: p.121, even goes so far as to suggest that “deep concentration is a major obstacle to insight prac￾tice”.
4.96	According to S I 120, the monk Godhika committed suicide because on six successive occasions he had attained and lost “temporary liberation of the mind”, which accord￾ing to Spk I 182 refers to a “mundane” attainment, i.e. some concentrative attainment. The commentary explains that his repeated loss of the attainment was because of ill￾ness. According to a statement made by the Buddha after the event, Godhika died as an arahant. The commentary suggests that his realization took place at the moment of death (cf. also the similar commentarial explanations of the suicide cases of Channa at M III 266 or S IV 59, and of Vakkali at S III 123).
4.97	S III 125.
4.98	Nett 43 explains that both samatha and vipassanā need to be developed, since samatha counters craving, while vipassanā counters ignorance. According to A I 61, the devel￾opment of both samatha and vipassanā is required to gain knowledge (vijjā). A I 100 stipulates the same two as requirements for overcoming lust, anger, and delusion. Awareness of their cooperative effect also underlies Th 584, which recommends prac￾tising both samatha and vipassanā at the right time. On the need to balance both cf. Cousins 1984: p.65; Gethin 1992: p.345; and Maha Boowa 1994: p.86.
4.99	Cf. de la Vallée Poussin 1936: p.193; Gombrich 1996: p.110; Griffith 1981: p.618, and 1986: p.14; Pande 1957: p.538; Schmithausen 1981: pp.214–17; and Vetter 1988: p.xxi. Kv 225 confutes a somewhat similar “wrong view”, involving two types of cessation (nirodha). 
4.100	A I 61.
4.101	Cf. e.g. M I 296; see further Lily de Silva 1978: p.120.
4.102	In fact, Vism 702 explains that the attainment of the cessation of cognition and feeling (saññāvedayitanirodha) cannot be reached by samatha alone, but requires insight of the non-returner’s level at least. Although this is not directly stated in the discourses, at M III 44, after all eight preceding concentrative attainments have been distinguished according to whether they are attained by the unworthy person or by the worthy person (sappurisa), once the attainment of the cessation of cognition and feeling comes up the unworthy person is no longer mentioned, thereby indicating that this attainment is the sole domain of the worthy person (a term which on other occasions is used on a par with “noble”, cf. e.g. M I 300). This clearly shows that the attainment of the cessation of cognition and feeling is not merely the outcome of concentrative mastery, but also requires the development of insight, a fact that is hinted at in the standard descriptions with the expression, “having seen with wisdom, the influxes are destroyed” (e.g. at M I 160). Cf. also A III 194, which appears to relate the cessation of cognition and feeling to arahantship and non-returning in particular. In fact, according to S IV 295, samatha and vipassanā are both required for the attainment of the cessation of the cognition of feeling.
4.103	S II 121.
4.104	Gombrich 1996: p.126.
4.105	In this context it is telling that A IV 452 lists different types of arahants “freed by wis￾dom”, all of them, however, able to attain jhāna.
4.106	S II 115. Cf. de la Vallée Poussin 1936: p.218; and Gombrich 1996: p.128.
4.107	Spk II 122.
4.108	Critical assessments of the “two paths theory” can be found in Gethin 1997b: p.221; Swearer 1972: pp.369–71; and Keown 1992: pp.77–9, who concludes (p 82): “two types of meditation technique … exist precisely because final perfection can only be achieved when both dimensions of psychic functioning, the emotional and the intel￾lectual, are purified.”
4.109	Paṭis I 21. On the interrelation of both in the Sarvāstivāda tradition cf. Cox 1994: p.83.
5.1	This expression is suggested by W.S. Karunaratne 1979: p.117.
5.2	Ṭhānissaro 1996: p.79, alternatively speaks of a basic pattern of three stages under￾lying the “refrain”.
5.3	M I 56. For the other satipaṭṭhānas, each instance of “body” in the above instruction should be replaced with “feelings”, “mind”, or “dhammas”.
5.4	Cf. S V 294, according to which to contemplate both internally and externally is the proper way to undertake satipaṭṭhāna.
5.5	This can to some extent be inferred from the way the “refrain” is worded, since atten￾tion now shifts from a particular instance (such as, for example, “a worldly pleasant feeling”) back to the general area (such as “feelings”).
5.6	On the importance of shifting from content to general process cf. Brown 1986a: p.233; Goldstein 1994: p.50; and Kornfield 1977: p.19. According to Engler 1986: p.28, one of the reasons western meditators tend to progress more slowly than their eastern coun￾terparts is “the tendency to become absorbed in the content of awareness rather than continuing to attend to its process … become preoccupied with individual thoughts, images, memories, sensations etc., rather than keeping their attention focused on the essential characteristics of all psycho-physical events, whatever the content … a ten￾dency to confuse meditation with psychotherapy and to analyse mental content in￾stead of simply observing it.” On the same problem cf. also Walsh 1981: p.76. The need to contemplate the general characteristics of anicca, dukkha, and anattā when cultivat￾ing satipaṭṭhāna is also noted in the Abhidharmakośabhāëyam (in Pruden 1988: p.925).
5.7	Jumnien 1993: p.279, aptly describes this stage of practice: “at some point the mind be￾comes so clear and balanced that whatever arises is seen and left untouched with no interference. One ceases to focus on any particular content and all is seen as simply mind and matter, an empty process arising and passing away of its own … a perfect balance of mind with no reactions … there is no longer any doing.…”
5.8	Cf. Mahasi 1990: pp.17 and 21: “the actual method of practice in vipassanā meditation is to … observe … the successive occurrences of seeing, hearing, and so on, at the six sense doors. However, it will not be possible for a beginner to follow these on all suc￾cessive incidents as they occur, because his mindfulness, concentration and knowl￾edge are still very weak.… A simpler and easier form of the exercise for a beginner is this: With every breath there occurs in the abdomen a rising–falling movement. A be￾ginner should start with the exercise of noting this movement.” Mahasi 1992: p.75: “we used to instruct the yogi whose powers of concentration have strengthened to extend this method of meditation to noting all that happens at his six sense doors.” Ba Khin 1985: p.94: “in fact one can develop the understanding of anicca through any of the six organs of sense. In practice, however, we have found that … the feeling by contact of touch … is more tangible than other types of feeling and therefore a begin￾ner in Vipassanā meditation can come to the understanding of anicca more easily through bodily feelings.… This is the main reason we have chosen the body feelings as a medium for the quick understanding of anicca. It is open to anyone to try other means, but my suggestion is that one should have oneself well established in the understanding of anicca through bodily feelings before an attempt is made through other types of feeling.”
5.9	Dhs 187; same at Vibh 2–10 for each aggregate. Cf. also Vism 473.
5.10	This is, in fact, implied by the presentation at D II 216, where internal satipaṭṭhāna con￾templation leads to concentration, which then enables one to undertake external con￾templation. Cf. also S II 127, where contemplation of the states of mind of others forms part of a list of deep concentrative attainments, which suggests that here too such contemplation is understood as an exercise of psychic powers. Cf. also Ṭhānissaro 1996: p.76.
5.11	S V 143. Similarly S V 294; S V 297; and A III 450 treat these three modes as distinct con￾templations. Several discourses apply the distinction between the internal and the external individually to feelings, to the hindrances, to the awakening factors, and to the aggregates (cf. e.g. M III 16; S IV 205; and S V 110). These passages suggest that the application of “internal” and “external” to all satipaṭṭhānas in the “refrain” is not merely a case of meaningless repetition, but has to have some significance in each case. Cf. also Gethin 1992: p.54.
5.12	Vibh 193 (this occurs in the Suttanta exposition).
5.13	Vibh 228. In fact, the satipaṭṭhāna commentary explicitly applies “external” to each satipaṭṭhāna technique, to the breath at Ps I 249, to the postures at Ps I 252, to bodily activities at Ps I 270, to the bodily parts at Ps I 271, to the elements at Ps I 272, to the cem￾etery contemplations at Ps I 273, to feelings at Ps I 279, to the mind at Ps I 280, to the hindrances at Ps I 286, to the aggregates at Ps I 287, to the sense-spheres at Ps I 289, to the awakening factors at Ps I 300, and to the four noble truths at Ps I 301.
5.14	S V 110.
5.15	Khemacari 1985: p.26.
5.16	D III 103 and A I 171. Cf. also M I 318, which recommends investigating by way of see￾ing and hearing for monks without telepathic powers in order to be able to assess the Buddha’s mental purity; or else M II 172, where observing the bodily and verbal con￾duct of a monk forms the basis for assessing whether his mind is under the influence of greed, anger, or delusion.
5.17	Ehara 1995: pp.58–61; and Vism 101–10. Cf. also Mann 1992: pp.19–51.
5.18	Mann 1992: p.112, speaks of realizing “that the forces at work within other people are the same as the forces that motivate our own behaviour”. Similarly, insights gained during external contemplation will in turn also support internal contemplation. For example, it is comparatively easy to uncover the underlying motives of particular re￾actions in someone else, while the same motives might pass undetected if one is the actor oneself. Cf. also Bullen 1982: p.32; Khemacari 1985: p.23; and Ñāṇapoṇika 1992: p.58, who explains that “many things permit of better understanding when observed in others, or in external objects, than in oneself”.
5.19	Cf. also Ñāṇapoṇika 1951: p.35.
5.20	Ps I 249.
5.21	This is implicit in the way the respective contemplations are formulated at Vibh 195, according to which internally one understands: “I feel a pleasant feeling”, externally one understands: “he or she feels a pleasant feeling”, internally and externally one understands: “a pleasant feeling”. The same recurs at Vibh 197 for mind and at Vibh 199–201 for dhammas.
5.22	M II 246.
5.23	D II 216.
5.24	Goenka 1999: p.54; Solé-Leris 1992: p.82; and Thate 1996: p.44. This way of under￾standing “internal” and “external” could be supported with Th 172, where “internal” nd “external” are both used with regard to the speaker’s own body, so that here too they seem to be referring to the inner and outer parts of the same body.
5.25	M I 61: ajjhattikabāhiresu āyatanesu.
5.26	Dhammadharo 1993: pp.263–6; and Ñāṇasaṃvara 1961: p.27.
5.27	Cf. Jayatilleke 1980: pp.361–8; Kalupahana 1992: p.107; Karunadasa 1996: p.35; and W.S. Karunaratne 1988a: p.90. The term paramattha occurs at Sn 68; Sn 219; and Th 748. Elsewhere related terms occur, like paramañāṇa at A III 354, paramapaññā and parama ariyasacca at M III 245, paramasacca at M I 480, M II 173, and A II 115, and uttamattha at Dhp 403. All these instances are references only to Nibbāna. The presumption that the one-hundred-and-twenty-one types of mental states, fifty-two types of mental fac￾tors, and twenty-eight types of matter listed in the Abhidh-s can be considered “paramattha”, in the sense of being ultimately real, is a late development not found in the early discourses. For an exposition of this later conception of paramattha cf. Bodhi 1993: pp.6 and 25; and Ledi 1999b: p.99.
5.28	Dhammadharo 1987: pp.20 and 25, and Maha Boowa 1994: p.101, relate the distinction between internal and external to mental and physical feelings respectively, and to mind only (internal) and mind with an external object in the case of mind. Fessel 1999: p.105, understands “internal” to refer to internal mental experience and introversion, while “external” represents external influences and object-directed activities. Tiwari 1992: p.82, also relates “internal” to mental and “external” to physical feelings. Simi￾larly, the Mahāprajñāpāramitāśāstra considers internal feelings and states of mind to be those related to mind door events, while the corresponding external counterparts are those related to the other five senses (in Lamotte 1970: pp.1173–5). Ñāṇasaṃvara 1974: pp.28 and 71 applies this way of understanding to mindfulness of breathing, in the sense that the breath is “external”, while awareness of the breath is “internal”. This, however, does not yield meaningful alternative forms of practice, since the presence of both breath and awareness is required for “internal” and for “external” contemplation.
5.29	S V 279.
5.30	S V 110. However, it should be noted that the same discourse does not apply this distinction to sloth-and-torpor or to restlessness-and-worry, although both these hin￾drances could also arise owing to either mind door or five sense door experiences.
5.31	M I 60: “he knows ‘there is aversion in me’” (atthi me ajjhattaṃ); or M I 61: “he knows ‘there is the mindfulness awakening factor in me’” (atthi me ajjhattaṃ). These instruc￾tions do not seem to apply only to hindrances or awakening factors arising in relation to mind door events.
5.32	e.g. at D I 74. Other examples are “internal” calm of the mind at M I 213, or “internal” appiness (referring to jhāna) at M III 233.
5.33	M III 225: “seeing a visible object … cognizing a mental object … consciousness is dis￾tracted externally.” The phrase “internally stuck state of mind”, however, does indeed imply mental experience, namely attachment to the pleasure of jhāna.
5.34	e.g. M I 346 relates internal happiness to all six senses; or S IV 139 speaks of internal lust, anger, and delusion in relation to all six senses; or S V 74 relates an internally steady mind to all six senses.
5.35	This is suggested by several verses in the Sutta Nipāta, where “internal” and “exter￾nal” occur together in the sense of “whatever there is”, expressing a sense of compre￾hensiveness, cf. Sn 516; Sn 521; Sn 527; and Sn 738. The need for such comprehensiveness is not only a characteristic of satipaṭṭhāna practice, but also fea￾tures in a contemplation of emptiness described at M III 112, which similarly proceeds from “internal” to “external” and culminates in contemplation undertaken “both in￾ternally and externally”.
5.36	A similar shift towards comprehensiveness features in the standard descriptions on how to develop insight with regard to the five aggregates, where after a detailed ex￾amination of a single aggregate, the insight gained is applied to all possible instances of it (cf. e.g. M I 138).
5.37	This way of translating the compound is supported by its use at S III 171, where it clearly refers to the “nature of arising and passing away”. Cf. also Ñāṇatiloka 1910: p.95 n.1, who translates samudayadhamma as “the law of arising” (das Enstehungs￾gesetz); and Ñāṇamoli 1994: p.53, who translates vayadhamma “having the nature of fall”.
5.38	S III 171 and S IV 50.
5.39	S III 51 and S IV 142.
5.40	A III 2. Impermanence as the key aspect of insight is also emphasized by Fleischman 1986: p.11; Ledi 1999a: p.151; Ñāṇapoṇika 1992: p.60; Solé-Leris 1992: p.82; and Than Daing 1970: p.62.
5.41	According to Ledi (n.d): p.233, insight into arising and passing away is the key aspect of the insight knowledges and relevant for the progress to all four stages of awaken￾ing. Excellent expositions on the insight knowledges can be found in Mahasi 1994: pp.8–36; and Ñāṇārāma 1993: pp.19–62.
5.42	At D III 243; D III 251; D III 290; D III 291; S V 132; S V 345; A I 41; A III 85; A III 277; A III 334; A III 452; A IV 46; A IV 52; A IV 148; A IV 387; A IV 465; A V 105; and A V 309. (Literally translated, the pattern runs: “cognition of impermanence, cognition of unsatisfactoriness in the impermanent, cognition of not-self in the unsatisfactory”.) This pattern is also reflected in the statement “what is impermanent that is unsatisfac￾tory, what is unsatisfactory that is not-self”, e.g. at S III 22; S III 45; S III 82; S IV 1; and S IV 153. Cf. also Bodhi 2000: p.844. Ñāṇananda 1986: p.103, explains: “in ‘sukha‘ and ‘attā‘ we have the affective and conative reactions to the illusion of permanence.”
5.43	S III 67.
5.44	A III 443 and A III 447 relate awareness of impermanence to disenchantment in gen￾eral, while A IV 51 relates it in particular to being disinterested in worldly gains.
5.45	Awareness of the empty nature of what is unsatisfactory leads, according to A IV 53, to overcoming all notions of I or mine. Cf. also A IV 353; A IV 358; and Ud 37; according to which insight into not-self, being based on awareness of impermanence, leads to the eradication of all conceit and therewith to realization.
5.46	S V 183 explains the shift from mere satipaṭṭhāna to a “development” (bhāvanā) of satipaṭṭhāna to consist in contemplation of the nature of arising and passing away. This discourse is, however, missing from the Chinese Āgamas, cf. Akanuma 1990: p.247.
5.47	In fact, M I 62 speaks of the need to “develop” satipaṭṭhāna in order for it to lead to highest realization: “if anyone should develop these four satipaṭṭhānas … one of two fruits could be expected for him”; an expression that is reminiscent of the reference to “development” (bhāvanā) at S V 183. It is noteworthy that, in contrast to the emphasis the Pāli texts place on contemplation of impermanence, the Madhyama Āgama version of the satipaṭṭhāna “refrain” does not mention it at all. The Ekottara Āgama version, however, has preserved it at least in relation to contemplation of feelings, mind, and dhammas (cf. Minh Chau 1991: p.88; and Nhat Hanh 1990: pp.173, 175 and 177). The in￾junction to contemplate “arising” and “disappearing” in relation to all four satipaṭṭhānas occurs also in the Saṃyukta Āgama equivalent of the Samudaya Sutta (S V 184), cf. the translation in Hurvitz 1978: p.215.
5.48	Goenka 1994a: p.112.
5.49	M I 61: “such is material form … feeling … cognition … volitions … consciousness, such its arising, such its passing away.” Cf. further page 213.
5.50	Continuity in contemplating impermanence is mentioned at A IV 13 and A IV 145; cf. also Th 111.
5.51	A III 441.
5.52	A III 439.
5.53	A IV 224 and A V 174.
5.54	Cf. A III 377; A IV 404; A III 379; and Th 643.
5.55	Ps I 249.
5.56	S V 184. (However, this passage does not fully fit with the “refrain”, since the term used here is “disappearing”, atthagama, not “passing away”, vaya, as in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta.)
5.57	M I 22; M I 248; and A IV 176. S II 10 and S II 104 document his realization of dependent co-arising. The importance of the first two higher knowledges as exemplifications of impermanence and causality is noted by Demieville 1954: p.294; and Werner 1991: p.13; cf. also Lopez 1992: p.35. In addition to the above passages, the discourses docu￾ment the growth of the Buddha’s wisdom from a variety of angles, involving a con￾templation of the enjoyment, the inherent disadvantage, and the escape in relation to the elements (S II 170), the aggregates (S III 27; S III 29; and S III 59), the sense-spheres (S IV 7–10 and S V 206), feeling (S IV 233), the faculties (S V 204), the “world” (A I 258), and the four noble truths (S V 423). Each of these discourses directly relates the respective insight to the Buddha’s attainment of full awakening, which suggests that each of these insights can be considered a particular aspect of his comprehensive realization.
5.58	D II 31–5, where a detailed investigation of the conditional links leading from dukkha up to the reciprocal relationship between consciousness and name-and-form led on to his practice of the satipaṭṭhāna contemplation of the five aggregates, resulting in realization. A practical example of how impermanence and conditionality can be interrelated in the context of contemplation can also be found at S IV 211, which relates the conditioned arising of the three types of feelings to the impermanent nature of the body; (same at S IV 215 in regard to contact).
5.59	Cf. Kalupahana 1975: p.125.
5.60	See esp. Pûraṇa Kassapa and Makkhali Gosāla at D I 52. Cf. also Bodhi 1989: p.7.
5.61	A typical example can be found at S II 19, where the Buddha was asked whether dukkha was caused by oneself, by others, by both, or by neither (i.e. arisen by chance). After the Buddha had denied all four alternatives his interlocutor, surprised that all four ways of stating the causality of dukkha had been rejected, wondered whether the Buddha was simply unable to see or admit the existence of dukkha. A similar dialogue in relation to sukha dukkha occurs at S II 22. The novelty of the Buddha’s position can also be seen in the fact that the term paṭicca samuppāda was apparently invented by him in order to express his understanding of causality, cf. Kalupahana 1999: p.283. However C.A.F. Rhys Davids, in one of her imaginative interpretations of the Pāli canon, suggests that it was not the Buddha, but rather Assaji, who was responsible for the early Buddhist theory of causation (1927b: p.202).
5.62	Paṭis I 52. Bodhi 2000: p.741 n.50, points out that the scheme of four temporal modes (past cause, present result, present cause, future result) underlying the three-lifetime presentation has a predecessor at S II 24.
5.63	Jayatilleke 1980: p.450.
5.64	At D II 57, the first two links, ignorance and formations, as well as the six-sense-spheres link are missing, and consciousness is presented in a reciprocal rela￾tionship with name-and-form. The same reciprocal relationship between conscious￾ness and name-and-form occurs at D II 32; S II 104; and S II 113. Sn 724–65 relates each of the links separately and independently to dukkha. (On these variations of the stan￾dard twelve-link formula cf. also Bucknell 1999: pp.314–41.) S II 31 leads from igno￾rance to birth but then on to joy, concentration, and realization. A different course from craving onwards is also taken at S II 108. Furthermore at D II 63 consciousness is shown to condition name-and-form at conception, during the embryonic stage, and also during life, a presentation which does not seem to be confined to rebirth within the context of the three-life application only. Or at S III 96 formations, as a result of ignorance, are not a past experience, but arise in the present moment. Cf. also W.S. Karunaratne 1988b: p.30.
5.65	Collins 1982: p.106 points out that “it is crucially important to distinguish between the general idea of conditionality and the twelve-fold series”. Cf. also W.S. Karunaratne 1988b: p.33; and Ñāṇavīra 1987: p.31. Reat 1987: p.21: explains: “paṭicca samuppāda …the term may properly be applied to any set of results dependent upon necessary and sufficient conditions.”
5.66	S II 26. This same distinction can be deduced from the standard way in which the “twelve link” application of dependent co-arising is often introduced in the dis￾courses, where after a formulation of the principle (“when this is that comes to be …”) the twelve links are introduced with the Pāli expression “that is to say” (yadidaṃ), showing that the twelve links are an exemplification of the principle just stated (cf.e.g. S II 28).
5.67	A III 440 explains that a quality of a stream-enterer is that he or she has understood causality and the causal origin of phenomena.
5.68	S II 96, a contemplation which then leads to realization. Similarly, at S II 92 the Buddha illustrated the depth and importance of dependent co-arising with the help of only the final five links (from craving onwards), a presentation more easily amena￾ble to direct experience than the complete set of twelve links. That the entire set of twelve links is not necessarily intended for contemplation is also suggested by S II 81, where the Buddha recommended “thinking over” (parivīmaṃsati) the twelve links, using a type of terminology that points to a form of intellectual consideration. This suggests that a direct experience of the principle, gained through meditation, can then be applied to the twelve links by way of intellectual reflection, considering that the same principle operated in the past and will operate in the future, without any need to experience directly those past or future operations.
5.69	Vibh 164–92. On this passage cf. also Bodhi 1998: p.46 n.4; and Gethin 1997a: p.195. According to Buddhadāsa 1992: p.98, “the entire series of Dependent Origination operates … in a flash.… The … twelve conditions … may all arise, exercise their func￾tion and pass away, so fast that we are completely unaware of it.”
5.70	M III 299.
5.71	M I 111.
5.72	e.g. at M III 63: “when this exists, that comes to be; with the arising of this, that arises. When this does not exist, that does not come to be; with the cessation of this, that ceases.” On specific conditionality cf. also Bodhi 1995: pp.2 and 9; and Ñāṇamoli 1980: p.161.
5.73	The complexity of the conditional interrelation of phenomena is illustrated in the Paṭṭhāna of the Pāli Abhidhamma from a variety of angles with altogether twenty-four types of conditions. Thus, for example, the conditioning influence exercised by A on B (A → B) could, from a temporal perspective, take place not only with A arising ear￾lier than B (purejātapaccaya), but also if both arise simultaneously (sahajātapaccaya), or even when A arises later than B (pacchājātapaccaya). It could be the presence of A (atthipaccaya), but also its absence (natthipaccaya), that conditions B. Moreover A could be the active cause (kammapaccaya), or it could exert its conditioning influence while being itself a resultant effect (vipākapaccaya), or else A could be both cause and effect, when A and B are related to each other by way of mutuality condition (aññamaññapaccaya).
5.74	Tilakaratne 1993: p.41.
5.75	A III 415 explains that volition is the factor responsible for the undertaking of activities by way of body, speech, or mind.
5.76	M I 60: “he knows how unarisen sensual desire can arise, how arisen sensual desire can be removed, and how a future arising of the removed sensual desire can be pre￾vented.”
5.77	M I 61: “he knows the eye, he knows forms, and he knows the fetter that arises dependent on both, and he also knows how an unarisen fetter can arise, how an arisen fetter can be removed, and how a future arising of the removed fetter can be prevented.”
5.78	M I 62: “he knows how the unarisen mindfulness awakening factor can arise, and how the arisen mindfulness awakening factor can be perfected by development.”
5.79	According to the Mahāprajñāpāramitāśāstra, conditionality is indeed the distinctive characteristic of contemplation of dhammas, cf. Lamotte 1970: p.1169.
5.80	M I 55: “this is the direct path … for acquiring the true method … namely, the four satipaṭṭhānas.”
5.81	The standard recollection of the community of noble disciples (e.g. at A II 56) speaks of them being in possession of the right method (ñāyapaṭipanno).
5.82	S II 68; S II 71; S V 389; and A V 184 mention “noble method” as a quality of stream￾entry.
5.83	S V 388; cf. also A V 184. “Noble method” also comes up at A II 36, where it is further explained to be of a wholesome nature (kusaladhammatā), a reference that could also be alluding to dependent co-arising, since the commentary Mp III 74 relates this refer￾ence to the path of insight. T.W. Rhys Davids 1993: p.394, confirms that dependent co-arising is referred to as noble method. However, the term “method” can elsewhere assume different implications, since at M I 522 it comes to include attainment of the fourjhānas and the three higher knowledges, while at M II 182 it is related to overcom￾ing the ten unwholesome paths of action (cf. also M II 197, where it is not further spec￾ified but distinguished according to whether it is being developed by a householder or by a monk).
5.84	S II 43; S II 45; S II 59; S II 79; and S II 80; each relates an understanding of dependent co-arising to “standing at the threshold of the deathless”. A temporal succession with understanding of dependent co-arising preceding realization of Nibbāna seems also to be implied by the Buddha’s statement at S II 124, where he explained that “knowl￾edge of the stability of the Dhamma” (dhammaṭṭhitiñāṇa) precedes realization, since at S II 60 such “knowledge of the stability of the Dhamma” refers to dependent co￾arising. This is further supported by S II 25, which identifies specific conditionality as the “stableness of the Dhamma” (dhammaṭṭhitatā). Cf. also Choong 1999: p.50.
5.85	M I 56: “mindfulness that ‘there is a body’ is established in him to the extent necessary for bare knowledge and continuous mindfulness.” I take the prefix paṭi added to sati in the present context in its temporal nuance of “again” or “re-”, in the sense of point￾ing to the absence of lapses in the presence of sati, viz. its continuity.
5.86	Ps I 250; cf. also Ariyadhamma 1995: p.5; Debes 1994: p.130; Dhammiko 1961: p.189; and Ṭhānissaro 1993: p.101.
5.87	e.g. M I 56: “he knows ‘I breathe in long’”; M I 56: “he knows ‘I am walking’”; M I 59: “he knows ‘I feel a pleasant feeling’”; M I 59: “he knows a lustful mind to be ‘lustful’”; M I 60: “he knows ‘there is sensual desire in me’”; M I 61: “he knows ‘there is the mind￾fulness awakening factor in me’”; M I 62: “he knows as it really is, ‘this is dukkha‘”.
5.88	On labelling cf. Fryba 1989: pp.130–2; Mangalo 1988: p.34; and Ñāṇapoṇika 1986b: p.13.
5.89	Earle 1984: p.398; and Tilakaratne 1993: p.103. Epstein 1995: p.94, warns against simply “casting off … mental activity and thinking” since “people with this misconception abandon the ego skills necessary for successful meditation”. He explains (p 99) that “those with this misunderstanding … tend to overvalue the idea of the ‘empty mind’ free of thoughts. In this case, thought itself is identified with ego, and such persons seem to be cultivating a kind of intellectual vacuity, in which the absence of critical thought is seen as an ultimate achievement.” Ñāṇananda 1985: p.60, speaks of “rally￾ing the concepts for the higher purpose of developing wisdom whereby concepts themselves are transcended”.
5.90	D I 12–39, cf. in detail page 45, footnote 4 and page 181, footnote 34.
5.91	At A IV 110, because endowed with knowledge of the Dhamma the disciple will be able to overcome what is unwholesome and develop what is wholesome. Th 1027 recom￾mends knowledge of the discourses as the basis for living the holy life. Similarly, M I 294 lists knowledge of the discourses and related discussions as two of five factors required for right view to lead to realization. (The others are ethical conduct and the practice of samatha and vipassanā.)
5.92	In fact, even the fourth immaterial attainment (nevasaññānāsaññāyatana), a deep med￾itative experience as far removed from concepts as possible within the realm of mun￾dane experience, still falls short of realization. Cf. Hamilton 1996: p.60.
5.93	According to It 53, arahants, because of their penetrative understanding of concepts and verbal expressions, are able to use them freely, without in any way falling prey to them. Cf. also Ñāṇananda 1986: p.103: “to believe that by merely demolishing con￾cepts or theories one can rise above them is to stop at the fringe of the problem”.
5.94	M I 56. Kalupahana 1992: p.74, explains that the concepts used for satipaṭṭhāna “are to be pursued only to the point where they produce knowledge (ñāṇa-matta), and not beyond, for … conceptions carried beyond their limits can lead to substantialist meta￾physics”.
5.95	At S I 136 the Buddha described his realization as beyond the reach of mere theoretical inquiry. Cf. also Dhp 19; Dhp 20; Dhp 258; and Dhp 259; which emphasize that what really matters is the practice of the Dhamma. At A V 162, excessive emphasis on a theo￾retical understanding of the Dhamma even led some monks to mistakenly claim real￾ization. Cf. also W.S. Karunaratne 1988a: p.83.
5.96	A III 87. The same description, however, comes up at A III 178 in a recommendation to reflect on the Dhamma, demonstrating that the Buddha did not categorically reject such theoretical inquiry, but that his criticism was directed against neglect of the practice.
5.97	Cf. Chapter III.
5.98	This suggestion is supported to some extent by the commentary, Ps I 250, which relates this part of the “refrain” to mindfulness and clearly knowing.
5.99	M I 56: “he abides independent, not clinging to anything in the world.” 
5.100	D II 68; M I 251; M III 244; S II 82; S IV 23; S IV 24; S IV 65; S IV 67; S IV 168; and A IV 88. Similarly M III 266 relates the absence of dependencies to overcoming dukkha. Cf. also A V 325, which points out that an advanced meditator can meditate without “depend￾ing” on the material or the immaterial elements, or on any aspect of perceptual expe￾rience, a description which Spk V 79 relates to the experience of Nibbāna.
5.101	Ps I 250.
6.1	For the Madhyama Āgama version cf. Minh Chau 1991: p.88; and Nhat Hanh 1990: p.138. The other versions are (according to Schmithausen 1976: p.250) the Pañca￾viṃśatisāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā and the Šāriputrābhidharma. In contrast, the two Sati￾paṭṭhāna Suttas (D II 291 and M I 56) and the Kāyagatāsati Sutta (M III 89) place mindfulness of breathing at the outset of the body contemplations.
6.2	Ps-pṭ I 365 explains “considering” to refer to repeated analytical observation.
6.3	M I 57: “he reviews this same body … as full of many kinds of impurity.”
6.4	A III 323.
6.5	Minh Chau 1991: p.89; and Nhat Hanh 1990: p.154. These are the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth of the body contemplations in this version, which describe the physical effect of each of the four jhānas with the help of the same set of similes found in the Pāli discourses (kneading soap powder into a lump, a lake fed by water from within, lotuses submerged in water, and a man dressed all in white).
6.6	M III 92.
6.7	e.g. various ways of dealing with unwholesome thoughts are listed as the third and the fourth of the body contemplations in this version. (Pāli parallels to these exercises are the first and the last of the antidotes to unwholesome thoughts mentioned at M I 120.) Or else the tenth and the eleventh of the body contemplations in this version are concerned with developing a “brilliant perception” and with “well remembering the contemplated image”. These could correspond to clarity of cognition (āloka-saññā) and to the sign of concentration (samādhi-nimitta) found elsewhere in the Pāli dis￾courses. Cf. Minh Chau 1991: pp.88–90; and Nhat Hanh 1990: pp.153–6.
6.8	Nhat Than 1990: p.169.
6.9	Vibh 193. The commentary Vibh-a 252 further expands this to some extent by relating the anatomical parts to the four elements. Bronkhorst 1985: p.311, on the basis of this passage from the Vibhaṅga suggests that possibly the analysis into anatomical parts constitutes the most ancient and original approach to contemplating the body. Cf. also Lin Li-Kouang 1949: pp.122–7, who takes the entire Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta to be an elaboration of the more original Kāyagatāsati Sutta. A similar suggestion can be found in Schmidt 1989: p.41 n.3.
6.10	This emphasis can also be found in the fact that kāyagatāsati (mindfulness of the body), a word which in sutta usage is synonymous with kāyānupassanā (contempla￾tion of the body), came to connote only the contemplation of the anatomical parts in the commentaries; cf. also Bodhi 2000: p.1453 n.366; and Upali Karunaratne 1999a: p.168. This shift in meaning underlines the importance of contemplating the anatomi￾cal parts as ‘the’ body contemplation.
6.11	Cf. e.g. M I 500; M I 510; S I 131; A IV 377; A IV 386; Sn 197–9; Sn 205; Th 279; Th 453; Th 567–9; Th 1150–3; Thī 19; Thī 82–3; Thī 140; and Thī 466–71. These passages indicate that a somewhat negative attitude towards the body is not only a product of the commentarial writings (as suggested by Hamilton 1995b: p.61). Conversely, however, Heiler 1922: p.18, who speaks of a “vehement loathing of the body” (my translation of “ungestümer Ekel an allem Leiblichen”) as the aim of body contemplation, goes too far.
6.12	e.g. Vijayā at S I 131; Sāriputta at A IV 377; and Khemā at Thī 140; each stating that they feel ashamed and disgusted by their own body. However, this particular expression arose owing to the circumstances of each case, since Sāriputta was defending himself against the accusation of having physically shown lack of respect to another monk (cf. Mp IV 171), while the nuns Vijayā and Khemā were trying to discourage someone who was attempting to seduce them. In fact, the same expression occurs again at Vin III 68 and S V 320, where a number of monks engaged in contemplating the unattrac￾tive nature of the body with such fervour that they committed suicide, which is cer￾tainly not the appropriate way of carrying out this practice.
6.13	At S II 64 the Buddha pointed out that the body is neither one’s own nor does it belong to another, but is simply the product of conditions.
6.14	S V 170.
6.15	S IV 198.
6.16	Fryba 1989: p.111, fittingly speaks of “strategies of reality anchoring”. Tart 1994: p.44, explains: “instead of every thought carrying you away, you have an anchor in the here and now through your body”. Cf. also Nett 13, which points out that mindful￾ness of the body protects against sensory distraction.
6.17	According to M I 266, neglecting mindfulness of the body leads to delighting in feel￾ings and therewith to attachment.
6.18	M III 95.
6.19	M III 89.
6.20	M III 96.
6.21	The importance of a foundation in body contemplation for the practice of samatha or vipassanā is stressed by Ledi 1983: p.38, who compares attempts to practise either without a previous grounding in awareness of the body to driving an ox-cart yoked to an untamed bullock without a nose-rope. The importance of the body contempla￾tions for the development of samatha is also reflected at Ps I 301, which points out that mindfulness of breathing, of the anatomical parts, and of the bodily decomposition after death are satipaṭṭhāna contemplations particularly suitable for the development of concentration.
6.22	e.g. in the Majjhima Nikāya aspects of body contemplation are separately expounded as independent discourses (Ānāpānasati Sutta, M III 78; Kāyagatāsati Sutta, M III 88). Similarly the satipaṭṭhāna commentaries devote as much space to the body contempla￾tions as to the remaining three satipaṭṭhānas: Ps I 247–74 against Ps I 274–301 (each 27 pages).
6.23	e.g. at M III 94–9; A I 43; and Dhp 293.
6.24	A I 45.
6.25	A I 43. Cf. also D III 272 and S II 220.
6.26	Th 1035. (This statement was made by Ānanda after the passing away of the Buddha.)
6.27	Th 468.
6.28	Lin Li-Kouang 1949: p.124; and Schmithausen 1976: p.254. The impression that con￾templation of the body was known in ancient India is also to some extent supported by the introductory part to the Kāyagatāsati Sutta, M III 88, where the monks spoke in praise of the Buddha’s way of presenting body contemplation in such a manner that it would have manifold benefits. If the act of contemplating the body were in itself an innovation, it would most likely have merited their explicit praise.
6.29	Ps I 247 and Ps-pṭ I 348 maintain that other dispensations do not teach body contem￾plation as completely as the Buddha.
6.30	S V 326.
6.31	S V 326.
6.32	S V 317.
6.33	As a four-step satipaṭṭhāna in the (Mahā-)Satipaṭṭhāna Suttas at D II 291 and M I 59; as a sixteen-step practice in the Ānāpānasati Sutta at M III 79; as a saññā e.g. at A V 111; and as ānāpānasatisamādhi in the Ānāpāna Saṃyutta (e.g. at S V 317); cf. Vajirañāṇa 1975: p.227.
6.34	S V 317–19 list the overcoming of worldly intentions, of aversion and attraction, attain￾ing the four jhānas and immaterial attainments, and realization as potential benefits of mindfulness of breathing.
6.35	S V 321 and S V 316.
6.36	A III 449; Ud 37; and It 80. The Abhidharmakośabhāëyam explains that mindfulness of breathing is particularly suitable for countering discursive thought because the breath is a bland meditation object, devoid of colour or outer form, and therefore does not in itself stimulate the imaginative tendency of the mind (in Pruden 1988: p.917).
6.37	M I 426.
6.38	M I 56.
6.39	From these three, the root of a tree stands in a particularly close relation to the practice of meditation; so much so that at M II 118 the mere sight of secluded trees led a king to associate them with the practice of meditation and thereby reminded him of the Buddha. Similarly, the space occupied by the root of a tree can act as a standard for measuring the area a meditator is able to pervade or suffuse with his or her practice (cf. M III 146). The root of a tree as a dwelling place constitutes also one of the four basic monastic requisites of a Buddhist monk or nun (together with almsfood, cast-off cloth for robes, and cow urine as medicine) and thus conveys nuances of contentment with the most minimal necessities of life. The “forest” and the “root of a tree” form part of the standard expression for introducing formal meditation (e.g. at D I 71). The “root of a tree” and the “empty hut” come up in the Buddha’s emphatic exhortation to meditate (e.g. at M I 46). In addition to forming part of the introduction to mindful￾ness of breathing, the same three types of place occur in relation to various other meditation practices: at M I 297 in relation to reflection on emptiness; at M I 323 in rela￾tion to overcoming the hindrances; at M I 333 in relation to the attainment of cessa￾tion; at M I 335 in relation to the divine abodes; at M I 336 in relation to unattractiveness of the body, awareness of repulsiveness in food, disenchantment with the whole world, and contemplation of impermanence; and at A V 109 in rela￾tion to the aggregates, to the sense-spheres, to various bodily illnesses, and to recol￾lection of Nibbāna.
6.40	Cf. Ps I 247. Ps I 248 stresses that it is not easy to develop mindfulness of breathing in the presence of noise and distractions. Similarly Vibh 244 speaks of a forest and the root of a tree as solitary and silent places and therefore appropriate for retirement into meditative seclusion.
6.41	Gunaratana 1981: p.10; and Khantipālo 1986: p.11.
6.42	The expression “having folded his legs crosswise” is not further explained in the dis￾courses. The commentaries take it as representing the lotus posture (e.g. Sv I 209), but in view of modern practical experience it seems reasonable to include any cross￾legged sitting posture in which the back is kept straight and which can be maintained for a reasonably long time without causing pain.
6.43	The description of the sitting posture occurs in relation to overcoming the hindrances and developing absorption as part of the standard expositions of the gradual path, e.g. at D I 71; in the context of practising the divine abodes (brahmavihāras) at D III 49 and A I 183; in relation to contemplation of the five aggregates at M I 421; in the context of recollecting realization or levels of insight gained at A I 184; Ud 46; Ud 60; and Ud 77; in relation to mindfulness of the body at Ud 27 and Ud 77; and in the context of meditation in general at Ud 43.
6.44	This ambiguity arises because mukha can assume a variety of meanings, among them “mouth” and “face”, and also “front” and “top”, cf. T.W. Rhys Davids 1993: pp.533–4.
6.45	Paṭis I 176 explains sati qualified as parimukhaṃ to mean that it “provides” a “way out” (of forgetfulness). Fessel 1999: p.79, suggests understanding the term in contrast to the Sanskrit bahir mukha (averting one’s face), parimukhaṃ then implying presence of mind directed to the immediate environment. T.W. Rhys Davids (1993) has: “to sur￾round oneself with watchfulness of mind” (p 672), and “to set one’s mindfulness alert” (p 431). The corresponding passage from the Chinese Āgamas reads: “with thoughts well controlled, not going astray” (in Minh Chau 1991: p.99). In fact, in sev￾eral discourses the expression “mindfulness established in front” was used by people who were apparently quite unfamiliar with meditation in order to describe the Buddha seated in meditation (a Brahmin searching for his ox at S I 170, a woodworker at S I 179, and some Brahmin students at S I 180). It is difficult to imagine that these people should have been able to know, from merely seeing the Buddha seated, that he was directing awareness to his nostrils. The more probable explanation for these instances is that “mindfulness established in front” was used by them just to express the visible fact that the Buddha was sitting in meditative composure.
6.46	Vibh 252 explains it to refer to the nose tip or the upper lip; same at Paṭis I 171; and in Ehara 1995: p.157. Vism 283 further explains that the nose tip is the appropriate point of observation for meditators with a longer nose, while the upper lip fulfils the same function for those who have a shorter nose.
6.47	D III 49; M I 274; and A IV 437 relate mindfulness established “in front” to overcoming the hindrances; A I 183 to the divine abodes. Other occurrences of the expression “es￾tablishing mindfulness in front” occur in the context of forming the determination not to change one’s posture until realization is gained (at M I 219), in relation to devel￾oping a mind set on the welfare of both oneself and others (at M II 139), when direct￾ing the mind to the reflective understanding that the defilements have been eradicated from one’s mind (at A I 184), or as part of the description of a monk well versed in meditation (at A III 320). It may also be worth while to point out that the qualification “in front” appears to be more than simply part of a stereotype formula, since in several passages in the Udāna it is missing from otherwise identical descrip￾tions of meditators sitting down cross-legged (Ud 21; Ud 42; Ud 43; Ud 46; Ud 60; Ud 71; and Ud 77).
6.48	According to the standard expositions (e.g. D III 49; M I 274; M III 3; or S V 105) the an￾tidotes for each respective hindrance are: attending to the unattractiveness of the body, loving kindness, clarity of cognition, mental calm, and being unperplexed about wholesome states. Particularly interesting in this context is M I 421, where Rāhula sat down to establish mindfulness “in front” in order to contemplate the aggregates, but was only at a later point given instructions in mindfulness of breath￾ing. This suggests that he had not previously received instructions in mindfulness of breathing, so it is not very probable that he was directing awareness to his nostrils during the contemplation of the aggregates that he had been taught previously.
6.49	The instructions describe a form of radiation (e.g. at M II 207) that does not seem to be in any way related to mindfulness of breathing.
6.50	Dhammadharo 1987: p.16, and Maha Boowa 1983: pp.14–16, instruct one to fix atten￾tion at the nose at first, but to shift to the chest or solar plexus area later on. Kamalashila 1994: p.168, proposes to counter slackness of energy by observing the breath higher up in the body (e.g. the nose), while in case of excess energy one can calm down by using a spot lower down (e.g. the abdomen). Brahmavaṃso 1999: p.17, suggests not locating the breath anywhere physically. On the other hand, Kassapa 1966: p.242, sharply criticizes the Mahasi tradition for observing the movement of the breath at the abdomen. However, in order to avoid contradiction with the commentarial explanation, the Mahasi tradition has always taken care to present their main meditation practice as a contemplation of the air element (as one of the ele￾ments mentioned in the instructions for meditating on the four elements), not as a form of mindfulness of breathing.
6.51	According to Chit Tin 1989: p.44, this instruction refers in particular to clearly distin￾guishing between the in-breath and the out-breath.
6.52	The relation of shorter breaths to the development of some degree of concentration is noted by Dhammadharo 1996: p.19; Dhīravaṃsa 1989: p.46; Goenka 1999: p.29; and Khantipālo 1981: p.30.
6.53	D II 291 and M I 56.
6.54	Ariyadhamma 1995: p.3, moreover explains the simile of the turner to indicate fixity of attention.
6.55	Paṭis I 185 in commenting on the third step of mindfulness of breathing.
6.56	According to Buddhadāsa 1976: p.63, the first two steps are preliminaries, and the real practice starts with this “training”.
6.57	In fact at S V 326, which documents the Buddha’s own practice of mindfulness of breathing, all occurrences of “he trains” are replaced by “I know”. This indicates that, unlike the ordinary practitioner who has to make an effort in order to proceed through the sixteen steps, the Buddha, with his meditative expertise, was able to do so effortlessly.
6.58	Cf. also Kor 1993: p.35; van Zeyst 1981: p.94; and Vimalo 1987: p.158. Shapiro 1984: p.588, suggests that from a psychological perspective awareness of the breath teaches one to be self conscious. Observation of the breath is indeed an appropriate vehicle for such self-observation, because emotional changes are reflected in the breath, such as when one yawns out of boredom, sighs in grief, or snorts in anger. Moreover, since breathing is a process that can take place either involuntarily or deliberately, it stands in a distinctive conditional position in regard to body and mind, and therefore offers a convenient opportunity to contemplate the conditional interrelationship between physical and mental phenomena. Cf. also Govinda 1991: pp.27 and 110.
6.59	Buddhadāsa 1989: p.38; Debes 1994: p.105; Goenka 1999: p.29; Kor 1993: p.38; and Solé-Leris 1992: p.80.
6.60	Vism 273.

6.63	At M I 301 and S IV 293 (cf. also Ñāṇamoli 1982a: p.6 n.1).
6.64	The calming of the bodily formation (in the sense of in- and out-breathing) reaches its culmination with the attainment of the fourth absorption (cf. D III 270 and A V 31), be￾cause during this attainment the breath completely ceases (cf. S IV 217). Pa Auk 1995: p.15, explains: “with the attainment of the fourth jhāna the breath completely stops. This completes the fourth stage in the development of ānāpānasati, calming the breath body.” Such complete calming, however, does not form part of the sixteen steps, since it would be difficult to reconcile with the subsequent progression towards experienc￾ing joy (pīti) and happiness (sukha); mental qualities that have been left behind with the attainment of the fourth jhāna. In fact, once the breath has completely ceased, it is impossible to carry out the instruction to breathe in (and out) while calming the bodily formations.
6.65	Paṭis I 184; Ehara 1995: p.161.
6.66	According to Vism 274, calming body and mind leads in turn to calming the breath. Cf. also Jayatilleke 1948: p.217, who suggests that breathing may be taken as one con￾crete instance of bodily formations in the general sense of bodily reflexes. In fact “bodily formation” occurs at times as bodily action in general (e.g. at A I 122; or at A II 231–6), a usage that is not restricted to the breath. Cf. also Schumann 1957: p.29.
6.67	M III 82. Cf. also Kor 1993: p.38.
6.68	According to Vism 277, and 287–90, the second and third tetrads are practicable for jhāna-attainers only. (Cf. also Ehara 1995: p.161; and Ledi 1999c: pp.27 and 29.) Vism suggests two alternatives, either actual development of jhāna, or insightful contem￾plation after emerging from jhāna. Nevertheless, both of these would only be practica￾ble for someone able to enter absorption. The net result is that, for someone unable to attain jhāna, a considerable part of the Buddha’s exposition on mindfulness of breath￾ing moves beyond reach. Quite possibly because of this, additional methods came into being for the less proficient in concentration, such as counting the breaths (cf. Vism 278–83 for detailed instructions). Instructions of this type are not found any￾where in the discourses of the Buddha. Though counting the breaths may be helpful for the newcomer to mindfulness of breathing, it does to some extent constitute a change in the mood of this contemplation, since sustained counting can dull the mind (which is the reason underlying the traditional advice to use counting exercises to conquer insomnia) and also tends to stimulate the conceptual activity of the mind instead of quietening it.
6.69	Kheminda 1992: p.5: “the four foundations of mindfulness begin with a serenity (samatha) subject of meditation, namely, mindfulness of in-breathing and out-breath￾ing”. Soma 1995: p.360: “the placing of the first tetrad of the Ānāpānasati Sutta at the very beginning of the two main Satipaṭṭhāna Suttas is clear indication of the necessity of at least the first jhāna … the development of insight is impossible to one who has not brought into being … at least the first jhāna.” Ps I 249, however, only suggests that based on the breath jhāna may be attained, not that mindfulness of breathing in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta is only a samatha object of meditation. This impression is further supported by the fact that the Satipaṭṭhāna subcommentary Ps-pṭ I 349 makes a point of stating that an external development of mindfulness of breathing cannot yield absorption attainment. This shows that in the eyes of the commentaries mindfulness of breathing in the satipaṭṭhāna context can be undertaken independently of absorp￾tion attainment.
6.70	In fact the definition of joy (pīti) in this context at Paṭis I 187 uses a set of expressions that are not restricted to absorption attainment. Similarly at M II 203 the joy of the first two absorptions is contrasted with the joy arising through sensuality, documenting a type of joy (pīti) distinctly different from that experienced during absorption attain￾ment. Cf. also Buddhadāsa 1989: p.51.
6.71	Dhp 374.
6.72	Such use of the breath as a means to develop insight into impermanence has a parallel at A III 306 and A IV 319, where a recollection of the inevitability and unpredictability of death is related to the unpredictability of the next breath. Cf. also S V 319, where the practice of the sixteen steps of mindfulness of breathing leads to realization of the im￾permanent nature of feelings.
6.73	Cf. e.g. Th 548, which recommends practice of mindfulness of breathing in “right order”, demonstrating a clear awareness of this inherent progressive character. A detailed exposition of the sixteen steps as a single integrated practice can be found in Buddhadāsa 1989: pp.53–89. Cf. also Gethin 1992: p.59; Levine 1989: pp.32–6; Ṭhānissaro 1993: p.67; and Vimalo 1987: p.158.
6.74	M III 78. Cf. also S V 315, where the Buddha introduced a monk, who was already practising some form of mindfulness of breathing, to the sixteen steps in order to fur￾ther his practice. Cf. also Debes 1994: p.197.
6.75	At M III 83 the Buddha related each tetrad from the sixteen-step scheme to a particu￾lar satipaṭṭhāna, while at M III 87 he provided the relation to the awakening factors. The same correlations occur at S V 323–36. S V 312 moreover relates mindfulness of breathing to each awakening factor singly.
6.76	The insight potential of any of the sixteen steps is described at Paṭis I 95, which points out that each step can lead to realization. Paṭis I 178–82 illustrates this potential by re￾lating the first step of mindfulness of breathing (long breath) to experiencing the rise and fall of feelings, cognitions, and thoughts, to the awakening factors, and to the ex￾perience of Nibbāna. Cf. also Ñāṇamoli 1982b: p.163.
6.77	M I 56.
6.78	Cf. M I 120, where a progression from fast walking to slow walking, to standing, to sit￾ting, and finally to lying down, is each time accompanied by the comment that in this way a gross posture is substituted by a subtler one. Cf. also Fessel 1999: p.111.
6.79	Proprioception is the ability to sense the position, location, and movement of the body and its parts.
6.80	e.g. at A IV 301.
6.81	Th 570.
6.82	Detailed practical instructions can be found in Mahasi 1991: pp.9–16. Cf. also Debes 1994: p.113; and Lily de Silva (n.d.): p.13.
6.83	Vism 622: predominance of earth + water = placing; predominance of fire + air = lift￾ing. Cf. also Sīlananda 1995: p.7.
6.84	M I 21 relates the four postures to overcoming fear; M III 112 to avoiding desires and discontent; A II 13 and It 116 to not tolerating unwholesome thoughts; and A II 14 and It 118 to overcoming the five hindrances.
6.85	According to Ehara 1995: p.61, the standing and walking postures are particularly suitable for lustful natured (rāgacarita) personalities, while sitting and reclining are more appropriate for anger natured (dosacarita) personalities. Vism 128 adds that whichever posture is effective for developing concentration is the one to be adopted. According to the satipaṭṭhāna commentary, Ps I 264, clearly knowing in regard to stretching and bending, an aspect of the next body contemplation, implies knowing the right time for performing such action, since the feelings arising from maintaining an uncomfortable posture for too long might obstruct the development of the medita￾tion. Chah 1993: p.40, points out that “some people think that the longer you can sit, the wiser you must be … wisdom comes from being mindful in all postures.” Simi￾larly Vimalaramsi 1997: p.47, suggests “it is far more important to observe what is hap￾pening in the mind than to sit with uncomfortable or painful sensations … there is no magic in sitting on the floor. The magic comes from a clear, calm mind.”
6.86	Dhammiko 1961: p.188. Fryba 1989: p.125, even suggests deliberately assuming the posture of an insecure and anxious person, then changing to express self-confidence in one’s posture, and in this way to experiment with various postures and their rela￾tionship to different emotions. Van Zeyst 1989: p.31, instructs: “one observes and is aware of how these movements are the expressions of one’s mental attitude: aggres￾sive in walking, or maybe escaping; defeated in lying down … standing in perplexity or expectation; sitting in satisfaction or in fear … neatness of movement in the desire to please … roughness of movement in anger and defeat … lack of movement in doubt and fear.”
6.87	Cf. e.g. S III 151, which describes how the worldling’s mistaken notion of a self is intri￾cately bound up with his or her adopting any of the four postures. According to Ñāṇapoṇika 1992: p.64, “mindfulness on postures will bring an initial awareness of the impersonal nature of the body”.
6.88	Ps I 251, because in this way the notion of an acting self can be overcome. Ps I 252 adds that this is to be applied to any posture.
6.89	Vism 640 explains that the characteristic of dukkha is concealed by the four postures. Naeb 1993: p.143, explains: “it is pain forcing … to change position at all times … we change in order to cure the pain … it is like nursing a continuous sickness … there is pain in all positions”. Similar suggestions can be found in the Mahā-prajñā-pāramitā-śāstra (in Lamotte 1970: p.1157); and in Ñāṇārāma 1997: p.29.
6.90	e.g. at D I 89; M I 229; M I 332; M II 119; M II 158; A V 65; and Ud 7.
6.91	The Buddha is reported practising walking meditation at D I 105; D III 39; D III 80; S I 107; S I 179; S I 212; Th 480 and Th 1044. His walking meditation took place during the night (at S I 107), and also during the day (at S I 179 and S I 212). S II 155 reports all the senior disciples engaged in walking meditation, each with a group of other monks.
6.92	A III 29. Improvement in health and digestion as benefits of walking meditation are also documented at Vin II 119. On the practice of walking meditation cf. also Khantipālo 1981: p.95; Kundalābhivaṃsa 1993: pp.75–8; and Ṭhitavaṇṇo 1988: pp.120–2.
6.93	Ps I 257 relates the story of a monk who realized arahantship after twenty years of sus￾tained walking meditation. Ps I 258 records the same realization for another monk after sixteen years of walking meditation.
6.94	M I 273: “while walking and sitting, we will purify our minds of obstructive states.” he expression “obstructive state” is a synonym for the five hindrances (cf. e.g. S V 94).
6.95	A IV 87.
6.96	e.g. at M I 273. The recommendation to sleep on one’s right side (in the “lion’s pos￾ture”) could arise from the fact that in this way the smooth working of the heart dur￾ing sleep is less obstructed by the weight of the body than when sleeping on one’s left side (which can cause unpleasant dreams).
6.97	Ñāṇavīra 1987: p.158.
6.98	Vin I 295 and A III 251.
6.99	Cf. A III 325, according to which awareness of the four postures forms the basis for mindfulness and clear knowledge.
6.100	M I 57. It is notable that most of the Pāli verb forms in this instruction are past partici￾ples, giving a nuance of passivity to the activities under observation. According to Kalupahana 1999: p.283, the Buddha used passive forms as a pedagogical device to highlight the characteristic of not-self. Another point worth considering is that the postures mentioned in the previous exercise recur in the present context. The com￾mentary, Ps I 269, explains that the difference between contemplating walking, standing, and sitting under contemplation of the postures and in the present exer￾cise is that here they are of comparatively shorter duration. The point the commen￾tary is trying to make could be that clear knowledge is particularly relevant to the moment when one assumes a particular posture (in terms of purpose and suitability etc.), whereas postural awareness is more profitably applied to being in a posture.
6.101	e.g. at D I 70.
6.102	On the basis of the common characteristics of the gradual path of training, as it is de￾scribed in various discourses (e.g. at D I 63–84; M I 179–84; M I 271–80; and M I 354–7), this pattern can be subsumed under five main stages: I. initial conviction and going forth; II. foundational training in ethical conduct and contentment; III. sense￾restraint and mindfulness and clear knowledge in regard to bodily activities; IV. abandonment of the hindrances and development of absorption; V. realization. These five steps represent, to some extent, the five faculties/powers: I. confidence, II. energy, III. mindfulness, IV. concentration, and V. wisdom; cf. Crangle 1994: p.163. However, it should be added that the five faculties and powers are not to be devel￾oped only sequentially, but should be brought into being together. Barnes 1981: p.237, suggests an alternative scheme of six steps by distinguishing between sense-restraint, on the one hand, and mindfulness and clear knowledge, on the other, as two separate stages.
6.103	Several discourses (e.g. M I 181; M I 269; and M I 346) explicitly mention clearly know￾ing in regard to activities as a precondition for subsequent formal sitting meditation. This foundational role is echoed at Ps I 290 and Ps-pṭ I 380, which recommend clearly knowing in regard to activities as a basis for developing sati as an awakening factor. Cf. also Bronkhorst 1985: p.311; and Bucknell 1984: p.29.
6.104	The difference in character between awareness directed to the postures and activi￾ties of the body and the later body contemplations has led Schmithausen 1976: pp.253–5, to the conclusion that the contemplations of the anatomical parts, of the el￾ements, and of a corpse could be later additions, because their character is somewhat different from the type of awareness practised during contemplation of bodily pos￾tures and clearly knowing in regard to bodily activities.
6.105	Cf. page 41.
6.106	At Ps I 253–61.
6.107	M III 113. This parallels an explanation found in the Satipaṭṭhāna subcommentary, Ps-pṭ I 364, which relates the development of clear knowledge in regard to speech to refraining from topics unsuitable for conversation.
6.108	At M I 460 and A II 123 as part of an instruction to a monk how to perform these bodily activities properly. At A IV 169 the whole set occurs again as a reference to proper be￾haviour, where a bad monk is trying to hide behind proper outer behaviour.
6.109	e.g. at A II 104 and at A V 201; cf. also Th 927 and Pp 44. Th 591 has the same qualifica￾tion for the four postures. Law 1922: p.81, translates sampajañña in this context as “deliberately.”
6.110	Minh Chau 1991: p.83.
6.111	These are in particular the seventy-five sekhiya rules, Vin IV 184–206. The importance of such outward behaviour is noted by Collins 1997: p.198. Holt 1999: p.102, points out that “the sekhiya rules … are much more than mere social etiquette: they are outward reflections of the inner state of a bhikkhu’s mental condition”. A convenient exposi￾tion of the sekhiya rules can be found in Ṭhānissaro 1994: pp.489–510.

6.115	A V 352 and S V 149; cf. also page 56.
6.116	Detailed descriptions of each part can be found in Ehara 1995: pp.171–7, and Vism 248–65. The Madhyama Āgama list of anatomical parts corresponds quite closely to the Pāli version (in Minh Chau 1991: p.90; and Nhat Hanh 1990: p.157), while the Ekottara Āgama has only twenty-four parts (Nhat Hanh 1990: p.170). According to Hayashima 1967: p.272, the Sanskrit versions of this satipaṭṭhāna contemplation mention alto￾gether thirty-six parts. (Indeed, a passage from the Ratnamegha, quoted in Bendall 1990: p.202, lists thirty-six anatomical parts for body contemplation.) The fact that in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta the anatomical parts listed are thirty-one could have some ad￾ditional significance, since in Buddhist cosmology the realms of existence are of the same number. Thus the descriptions of material existence on the microcosmic and the macrocosmic level were moulded on a similar pattern. Some of the anatomical parts listed in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta can also be found at Maitrī Upaniëad 1.3. Although this passage quite probably postdates the Pāli discourses, it nevertheless shows that this type of body contemplation was the domain not only of Buddhist practitioners.
6.117	M I 57.
6.118	M I 421 and M III 240.
6.119	Sn 199 mentions the brain. The brain is in fact added to the satipaṭṭhāna list by Paṭis I 7, and is also mentioned in the corresponding Chinese version in the Madhyama Āgama (in Minh Chau 1991: p.90). Vism 240 explains that the brain was not listed in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta because it was already covered by “bone-marrow”. The male or￾gan is mentioned at D I 106 and Sn 1022. The omission of the male organ from the satipaṭṭhāna list is not surprising, since the instructions have to be practicable for both male and female meditators; van Zeyst 1982: p.80, however, thinks that “with Victo￾rian prudence the thought of sex has been eliminated or by-passed”. Ear-wax occurs at Sn 197.
6.120	Debes 1994: p.124.
6.121	Vism 265.
6.122	These are the first two of four “attainments of vision” presented at D III 104. Cf. also S V 129, which points out that contemplation of the bones has many benefits.
6.123	Sn 193–201. The progression in this discourse also parallels the progression of the body contemplations listed in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, since it commences by directing awareness to the four postures and to stretching and bending, and concludes with a description of a dead body eaten by animals.
6.124	Sn 206.
6.125	In Nhat Hanh 1990: p.170.
6.126	Sn 197 and A IV 386.
6.127	According to A V 109, contemplation of the anatomical parts is concerned with “unattractiveness” (asubha), which It 80 explains to have the purpose of countering lust.
6.128	S V 278. A consideration of this passage needs to take into account the traditional Indian respect for higher parts of the body over its lower parts.
6.129	Thī 471.
6.130	Cf. also Vibh 193, which clearly indicates that contemplation of the anatomical parts has to be developed on oneself first, before it can be applied to others.
6.131	This is documented at M I 336, where the former Buddha Kakusandha recom￾mended contemplation of unattractiveness (of the anatomical parts) to his monks in order to counterbalance possible conceit at the excessive honour and veneration they were receiving from householders.
6.132	A III 323 relates contemplation of the anatomical parts to removal of lust; A IV 47 to developing disgust in regard to sexuality. Bodhi 1984: p.92, explains that “the medi￾tation aims at weakening sexual desire by depriving the sexual urge of its cognitive underpinning, the perception of the body as sensually alluring”. Cf. also Khantipālo 1981: p.98; and Mendis 1985: p.44. An additional external application is described at Vism 306, where the list of bodily parts is used for counteracting anger by reflecting whether one is angry with the other person’s hair, or skin, or bones, etc.
6.133	Vin III 68 and S V 320. On this passage cf. Mills 1992: p.74.
6.134	This “double-mouthed” bag (ubhatomukhā mutoíī) is, according to Schlingloff 1964: p.33 n.10, a piece of cloth used for sowing, with an upper opening for placing the grains inside, while the lower opening is used to sow the grains. This simile might have suggested itself because of the somewhat similar “double-mouthed” nature of the body, with an “upper opening” for placing food in, and a “lower opening” as the outlet for faeces.
6.135	Thī 33 and Thī 82–6.
6.136	M I 185; M I 421; and M III 240. According to Vism 348, the detailed expositions on the elements in these discourses are intended for the more slow-witted practitioners, while the comparatively brief instructions in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta are for those of quick understanding.
6.137	M I 57.
6.138	Cf. e.g. A III 340, according to which a tree trunk can be seen as a manifestation of each of the four elements, since each of them is but a quality of the same tree.
6.139	According to Vism 351, the four element analysis is a refinement of the previous contemplation.
6.140	M I 188; M I 422; and M III 241 explain the bodily manifestations of the elements fire and air. Practical instructions can be found in Fryba 1989: p.123; or in Pa Auk 1996: p.17; cf. also Ehara 1995: pp.197–205; and Vism 351. In some contexts the scheme of the four elements is extended to cover five or even six elements, e.g. at M III 240, by in￾cluding space and consciousness. These six elements form part of the satipaṭṭhāna in￾structions in the Madhyama Āgama version, while the version from the Ekottara Āgama has the same four that occur in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta (cf. Nhat Hanh 1990: pp.140, 158, 170). The element “space”, according to M III 242, refers to the empty and hollow aspects of the body.
6.141	Ps I 272 and Vism 348. A butcher occurs also at M I 364, where it is precisely his skill in cutting out a bone so that no flesh is left on it for a dog to satisfy its hunger which forms the central aspect of the simile.
6.142	e.g. M I 186 gives an extensive application of the four element meditation to both oneself and to the external environment; cf. also Debes 1994: p.139; and King 1992: p.39. Ñāṇananda 1993: p.10, aptly brings out the effect of this type of contemplation by speaking of conceit as “a misappropriation of public property (i.e. earth, water, fire, air)”.
6.143	Sn 937 points out that the world is entirely without essence. Cf. also M III 31, accord￾ing to which realization of the selfless nature of the four elements is a determining characteristic of full awakening.
6.144	M I 185 and M I 421 relate contemplation of the four elements to insight into not-self. The same discourses follow this by applying the understanding of not-self to a situa￾tion when one is being abused or harassed by others. A II 164 similarly relates con￾templation of the four elements to insight into not-self, which in this way can lead to full awakening. Cf. also Vism 640.
6.145	M I 185. Cf. also Ledi 1986b: p.72, who suggests beginning insight meditation with this particular exercise as a basis, as it will help to rapidly develop an understanding of impermanence.
6.146	S II 170 points out that against the pleasure and enjoyment arising in dependence on the four elements stands their impermanent and therefore unsatisfactory nature; thus the only way out of this predicament is to develop detachment in regard to them.
6.147	M I 423.
6.148	This is exemplified at A IV 374 by Sāriputta who, wrongly accused of an offence, reacted by stating that his mind was free from resentment, just as the earth does not resent refuse being thrown on it.
6.149	Ñāṇamoli 1995: p.1191 n.150: “seyyathāpi suggests that this meditation … need not be based upon an actual encounter with a corpse … but can be performed as an imagi￾native exercise”. Vism 180 describes in detail how a meditator can gain the first vision of a decaying corpse in a charnel ground and subsequently develop this vision while meditating in his lodging. According to Ledi (n.d): p.58, this contemplation might similarly be developed based on sick or wounded persons (including oneself), or with dead animals as the object. Cf. also Thate 1997: p.11.
6.150	M I 58.
6.151	T.W. Rhys Davids 1997: p.80.
6.152	M III 91 and A III 323 subsume the same description under four main stages: the bloated body, the body eaten by animals, the skeleton, and the bones. The Madhyama Āgama version describes a contemplation of the same process in five stages, while the Ekottara Āgama version gives altogether eight stages (in Nhat Hanh 1990: pp.158 and 170).
6.153	Rockhill 1907: p.23.
6.154	e.g. Dhp-a III 108 reports that the Buddha conducted his disciples to see the rotting corpse of the beautiful courtesan Sirimā as a countermeasure to sensual desires. As 197 recommends the contemplation of a rotting corpse for those whose character

6.156	According to A III 323, contemplation of a corpse counters conceit.
6.157	Ṭhānissaro 1993: p.55.
6.158	Th 393–5 and Th 315–16. Another instance of a monk meditating in a cemetery can be found at Th 151–2.
6.159	Ps I 254.
6.160	In fact Ledi (n.d): p.59, recommends corpses of the opposite sex for vipassanā pur￾poses, while corpses of the same sex are according to him suitable for the develop￾ment of samatha. On contemplating a corpse as a samatha practice cf. Vism 178–96.
6.161	Th 267–70.
6.162	A III 306 and A IV 319.
6.163	A III 308 and A IV 320 relate recollection of death to stirring up effort to counter evil; A III 304 and A IV 317 relate the same exercise to realization of the deathless.
6.164	Debes 1994: p.151; and Kor 1993: p.18. A certain degree of de-identification with the body during actual contemplation is in fact directly implied in the instructions for the last three contemplations (anatomical parts, elements, corpse), where one’s own body is referred to as “this same body” (M I 57–8), an expression that seems deliber￾ately to be voiced in an impersonal manner.
6.165	Cf. e.g. Th 20, where an arahant remarks that he is not afraid of death, ready to let go of the body mindfully. Cf. also A IV 48, which relates absence of attachment to life to having repeatedly recollected death.

7.4	M I 59.
7.5	A V 51. Cf. also S II 99.
7.6	According to S V 189, for a penetrative understanding of the three types of feelings the four satipaṭṭhānas are to be developed. It is remarkable that according to this pas￾sage all four satipaṭṭhānas are required for fully understanding feelings.
7.7	The Chinese version of this contemplation in the Madhyama Āgama additionally lists feelings connected with desire (and those which are not), and feelings related to food, while the Ekottara Āgama version directs awareness to the fact that the presence of one type of feeling excludes the presence of the other two (in Minh Chau 1991: p.93; and Nhat Hanh 1990: pp.161 and 173). The latter suggestion has its Pāli parallel at D II 66. Additional categories can also be found at Paṭis II 233, which includes feelings dif￾ferentiated according to the six senses under contemplation of feelings. In fact, ac￾cording to M I 398 the sixfold classification in the above satipaṭṭhāna instructions can be further expanded not only by bringing in the six senses, but also by distinguishing occurrences in past, future, and present times, thereby totalling one-hundred-and￾eight types of feeling altogether. An alternative threefold scheme for contemplation of feelings has been developed by Mogok Sayadaw (in Than Daing 1970: p.90) by dis￾tinguishing between five sense door feelings as “external visitors”, mental feelings as “internal visitors”, and feelings related to in- and out-breathing as “host visitors”.
7.8	A III 412.
7.9	Ps I 279 explains that worldly pleasant feelings are those related to the five sense￾pleasures, whereas their unworldly counterparts are those related to renunciation. Cf. also S IV 235, which distinguishes between joy or happiness that is worldly (sensu￾ality), unworldly (absorption), and completely unworldly (realization). The qualifica￾tion āmisa is often used in the discourses in the sense of “materialistic” as opposed to “dhamma”, e.g. monks honouring “material” things more than the Dhamma at M I 12 and A I 73 (cf. also A I 91–4); or a “material” gift at It 98. According to Goenka 1999: p.53, and Soni 1980: p.6, the same two terms are used in present-day India to distinguish between vegetarian and non-vegetarian food. Nhat Hanh 1990: p.71, understands the two terms to represent the distinction between physiological and psychological causes of feelings (e.g. a bad feeling resulting from having gone to bed late the night before would be “worldly”). Maurice Walshe 1987: p.591 n.658 and n.659 suggests “carnal” and “spiritual” as renderings.
7.10	Cf. M I 303; M III 285; and S IV 205. The relation of the three types of feeling to their re￾spective latent tendencies has inspired a variation of contemplation of feelings in the Ratnacûḍa Sûtra (quoted in Bendall 1990: p.219), where the instructions are that if one experiences a pleasant feeling, one should develop compassion towards beings in￾dulging in passion, while in the case of unpleasant feeling compassion is to be di￾rected towards beings indulging in hatred, and with neutral feeling towards beings subject to delusion.
7.11	M I 303.
7.12	Described in detail at D II 58.
7.13	According to Ps I 277, feelings are a clearer object for satipaṭṭhāna than consciousness or contact, because the arising of pleasant or unpleasant feelings is easily noticed.
7.14	This is exemplified at A IV 88, where the Buddha elaborated the injunction “nothing is worth clinging to” by teaching contemplation of the impermanent nature of feel￾ings, a contemplation he then showed to be capable of leading to realization.
7.15	M III 244 describes the arahant‘s detached attitude to feelings owing to his or her understanding of their impermanent nature.
7.16	M III 242.
7.17	S IV 218.
7.18	Debes 1994: p.227.
7.19	Ps I 275. The commentary explains that the purpose of this form of inquiry is to over￾come the notion of a self that feels. Cf. also D II 68, which points out two prominent identification patterns for feelings: “feeling is my self” and “my self feels”. These come, together with the view “my self is without feeling”, as three ways of construing a sense of self in regard to feeling. Their removal then leads to realization. On this pas￾sage cf. Bodhi 1995: pp.34–6. The importance of dissociating feeling from any notion of “I” or “mine” is also stressed by Ñāṇapoṇika 1983: p.4.
7.20	D I 16.
7.21	In fact, the Brahmajāla Sutta discusses sixty-two “grounds” for formulating views (D I 39: dvāsaṭṭhiyā vatthûhi), not sixty-two “views”. The actual number of views is much less, as e.g. the first four “grounds” make up the one “view” of eternalism, formulated in each instance in exactly the same terms. This shows that the Buddha’s analysis was mainly concerned with the epistemological grounds for formulating views, much less with the individual content of any of these views. When S IV 287 speaks of sixty-two “views” (dvāsaṭṭhi diṭṭhigatāni Brahmajāle bhaṇitāni) or Sn 538 of “heresies” (osaraṇāni), this does not really correspond to the terminology employed in the Brahmajāla Sutta itself.
7.22	At D I 39 the Buddha pointed out that all these different views arose for lack of knowl￾edge and vision on the part of those who propounded them, who were simply under the influence of feelings and craving. The commentary Sv-pṭ I 180 explains the gene￾sis of such views to be the outcome of not understanding the arising of feelings and therefore reacting to feelings with craving. Katz 1989: p.150, fittingly speaks of a “psychoanalysis of metaphysical claims”.
7.23	At D I 45 the Buddha explained that one who has understood the arising and disap￾pearance of contact (contact being the necessary condition for the arising of feelings and therewith of craving), has thereby realized what goes beyond all these views.
7.24	D III 141.
7.25	Cf. e.g. M I 111, which describes how one’s thoughts and reactions depend on the deci￾sive first input provided by feeling and cognition.

7.30	Padmasiri de Silva 1981: p.22; and Dwivedi 1977: p.255.
7.31	This is a recurrent theme throughout the Aṭṭhakavagga; see especially Sn 781; Sn 785; Sn 824; Sn 878; Sn 892; and Sn 910 on the dogmatic grasp engendered through views, and Sn 832; Sn 883; Sn 888–9; Sn 894; and Sn 904 on how this dogmatic grasp leads to deprecating others and to endless quarrelling. Cf. also Premasiri 1989: p.655, who aptly relates “view” to the concept of dogmatism.
7.32	Cf. also Bodhi 1992a: p.9; Burford 1994: p.47; Collins 1982: p.119; Gethin 1997b: p.222; and Gomez 1976: p.141.
7.33	The standard formulation of right view in the discourses is in fact directly concerned with attachment and clinging, formulated by way of the four noble truths (cf. e.g. D II 312). This scheme of the four noble truths is then applied to views themselves at A IV 68.
7.34	At M I 108 the Buddha, on being challenged to proclaim his view, answered that his view was such that it led to the absence of quarrelling with anyone. Cf. also M I 500, which relates understanding the impermanent nature of the three types of feeling to freedom from disputation. At S III 138 the Buddha summed up his non-contentious attitude with: “I do not dispute with the world, it is the world that disputes with me.”
7.35	A pragmatic attitude towards one’s own view is recommended at M I 323 and at A III 290, both instances specifying that the purpose of one’s view should be to bring about inner tranquillity and lead to freedom from dukkha.
7.36	Neither highly refined degrees of concentration, nor the pursuit of various ascetic practices, had been able to lead him to full awakening, so (at M I 246) he questioned himself: “Could there be another way to realization?” His unremitting effort to con￾tinue his quest even after exhausting all known approaches to realization might un￾derlie M I 219 and also A I 50, both instances presenting his awakening as the outcome of undaunted striving. His departure from all hitherto known ways of approaching realization is indicated by the expression “things unheard of before” (e.g. at M II 211 and S V 422).
7.37	M I 246. On this passage cf. also Horsch 1964: p.107. The discourse does not give his ex￾act age, though judging from the context it must have been at some point during his childhood. Mil 289 makes the rather improbable suggestion that he was only one month old and attained not just the first but all four jhānas. The Tibetan sources (Rockhill 1907: p.23) place this episode on the eve of his going forth, which also seems improbable.
7.38	M I 246 reports him as reflecting: “Why am I afraid of a happiness that has nothing to do with sensuality and unwholesome states? I am not afraid of such a happiness!” ased on this insight he realized awakening. Such understanding of the importance of an ethical evaluation of mental events is also reflected at M I 114 with his pre￾awakening division of thoughts into wholesome and unwholesome ones.
7.39	A I 136; cf. also Dhp 200.
7.40	D I 196; cf. also D II 215. According to Ps I 297 with full awakening, joy (as an awaken￾ing factor) also reaches perfection.
7.41	Th 35; Th 526; Th 545; Th 888; and Thī 24.
7.42	e.g. at M I 212, where the beauty of the moon-lit Gosiṅga forest became the occasion for several senior disciples to extol various qualities of a monk; or the descriptions of natural beauty in the verses of awakened monks at Th 13; Th 22; Th 113; Th 307–10; Th 523; Th 527–8; Th 601; Th 1062; Th 1064; Th 1065; Th 1068–70; and Th 1136. At D II 267, the Buddha even expressed his appreciation for a slightly sensuous piece of music per￾formed by the gandhabba Pañcasikha, whose song drew comparisons between the beauty of his beloved and the beauty of the life of arahants; on this passage cf. Gnanarama 1998: pp.119–21. On the appreciation of natural beauty by the Buddha and his monks cf. also Gokhale 1976: p.106; Kariyawasam 1984: p.359; and Nhat Hanh 1990: p.62.
7.43	M II 121; cf. also Rahula 1997: p.52. In fact, according to A V 122, one who delights in the Buddha’s teaching will experience happiness, whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down.
7.44	M I 476 and M I 454. The same understanding is also reflected at Th 742, which recom￾mends those types of pleasure that are related to the Dhamma; and in the expression “auspicious joy” (kalyāṇapīti) at Sn 969. Cf. also Premasiri 1981: p.69.
7.45	S II 30. Same sequence at Vin I 294, D I 73; D I 182; D I 207; D I 214; D I 232; D I 250; D III 241; D III 279; D III 288; M I 37; M I 283; S IV 78; S IV 351–8; S V 156; S V 398; A I 243; A III 21; A III 285; A V 1–6; A V 312; A V 315; A V 317; A V 329; and A V 333 (cf. also Paṭis I 85; and Vism 144). The supportive role of delight for realization is documented at Dhp 376; Dhp 381; and Th 11. According to Ayya Khema 1991: p.105, “inner joy is an absolute necessity for successful meditation”. Buddhadāsa 1956: p.109, speaks of the need to develop “perpetual spiritual joy”. The importance of pīti is also noted by Cousins 1973: p.120; Debes 1997: p.497; Gruber 1999: p.231; Ñāṇapoṇika 1988: p.20 n.9; and Sekhera 1995: p.104.
7.46	A V 2.
7.47	A III 435; the commentary Mp III 413 explains this as referring particularly to the need to avoid mental dullness. The importance of developing joy in the context of satipaṭṭhāna practice is also mentioned at S V 156.
7.48	M III 230.
7.49	M III 233; cf. also M I 398.
7.50	M III 217 relates the experience of mental joy to gaining insight into the impermanent nature of all sense experience; according to Th 398 and Th 1071 the pleasure of insight surpasses that of fivefold music; Th 519 points out that meditating free from craving yields the highest possible form of pleasure; Dhp 373 speaks of the divine pleasure of insight; and according to Dhp 374 insight into the arising and passing away of the aggregates leads to joy and delight.
7.51	M I 346 speaks of the happiness gained through maintaining pure ethical conduct (anavajjasukhaṃ), followed by the happiness derived from restraint of the senses (abyāsekasukhaṃ), which in turn leads to the progressive degrees of happiness experi￾enced during the first absorption (vivekajaṃ pītisukhaṃ), the second absorption(samādhijaṃ pītisukhaṃ), and the third absorption (sukhavihārī), and culminates in the happiness of realization (nibbuto sītibhûto sukhapaṭisaṃvedī). Cf. also Th 63 and Th 220, who speak of gaining happiness through happiness. Govinda 1991: p.61 explains: “cessation of suffering is supreme happiness and … every step towards that aim is ac￾companied by ever-increasing joy”. Warder 1956: p.57, even goes so far as to compare the Buddha’s emphasis on the importance of joy with Epicureanism.
7.52	Abhidh-s 1–7 presents a scheme consisting of sixty-three states of mind accompanied by mental joy (somanassa), three accompanied by mental displeasure (domanassa), and fifty-five accompanied by equanimity (upekkhā); cf. also Govinda 1991: p.63.
7.53	A similar emphasis can be found at Kv 209, which lists a total of twenty-eight types of happiness. Cf. also Vism 143, which reports that non-sensual joy can occur at five dif￾ferent levels, and details eleven factors conducive to its development (at Vism 132). Various types of happiness are also listed in the Vimuttimagga (cf. Ehara 1995: p.5).
7.54	The “smile-producing state of mind, accompanied by mental joy” mentioned at Abhi￾dh-s 2 among the rootless states of mind; cf. also Bodhi 1993: p.45. The arahant‘s smile is documented in several discourses for the Buddha and for Moggallāna, e.g. at Vin III 105–8; M II 45; M II 74; S I 24; S II 254–8; and A III 214.
7.55	e.g. M II 214, cf. also Jayawardhana 1988: p.409. Additional reasons for these practices might have been the prevalence of the idea that self-inflicted pain builds up spiritual power (iddhi), which can then be used to attain supernormal powers or attain libera￾tion; or the idea that the body is the source of craving and thus, in order to eliminate craving, the body is to be mortified.
7.56	S II 178; S III 149; and A V 113. Goldstein 1994: p.131, rightly points out: “the idea that enlightenment comes when we clear up our karma … is a mistaken view, because we are all trailing an infinite amount of past karma … enlightenment does not happen because we have gotten rid of a certain amount of karmic activity. It happens when our mind cuts through delusion.”
7.57	At S IV 230 the Buddha mentioned feelings originating from disorders of bile, phlegm, wind, imbalance of the bodily humours, change of climate, careless behaviour, or vio￾lence as alternatives to feelings resulting from karmical retribution. These alternatives are also enumerated at A II 87; A III 131; and A V 110; cf. also Ledi 1999d: p.66. In fact, according to A I 173 and A I 249 karma conceived as sole and absolute cause would imply a form of determinism and thereby logically exclude the possibility of living a life devoted to purification.
7.58	A V 292; A V 297; and A V 299 emphasize the impossibility of completely avoiding kar￾mic retribution. Dhp 127 points out that there is no spot in the whole world where one could escape the retribution of one’s evil deeds. Cf. also Ud 21, which reports a monk, seated in meditation, experiencing pain because of former deeds. However, as A I 249 points out, the intensity of karmic retribution depends to a great extent on the present moral and mental condition of the person in question, in the sense that a particularly unwholesome deed might lead an immoral person to hell, but will not have the same consequences in the case of an otherwise moral person.
7.59	A IV 382 clearly denies that the holy life under the Buddha is lived for the purpose of altering or eradicating karmic results that have not yet ripened, clarifying that the purpose is rather to develop knowledge and wisdom. To attempt to eradicate the results of past karma was a Jain position, which the Buddha criticized at M II 216 and M II 222.
7.60	The simple logic behind this it that the karmic results bound to ripen in future lives will no longer have an opportunity to produce results (cf. e.g. Th 81). In the case of the arahant Aṅgulimāla, for example, retribution for his former crimes could only take place within the limited scope of that same lifetime (cf. M II 104).
7.61	M II 93.
7.62	M I 95.
7.63	M I 241.
7.64	Cf. Padmasiri de Silva 1991: p.71.
7.65	S IV 208. The Buddha then illustrated the unawakened worldling’s predicament in the case of pain with being shot by two darts, since over and above the “dart” of phys￾ical pain, the mental reaction leads to more dukkha, viz. another dart. Cf. also Lily de Silva 1987: p.19; Kor 1991: p.6, and 1995: p.18.
7.66	S III 1 instructs: “you should train like this: my body may be sick, yet my mind will not be afflicted.” The discourse explains that the point is to avoid identification with any of the five aggregates (and thereby with the pain). This suggests a sense of dissocia￾tion from the experience of pain, as if the affected part of the body did not belong to one. Although one continues to be aware of the pain as an objective phenomenon, this act of dissociation or de-identification diminishes or even removes the affective impact of the pain on the mind.
7.67	According to S V 302, painful bodily feelings cannot overpower a mind well estab￾lished in satipaṭṭhāna. The Buddha himself, by remaining mindful and clearly know￾ing, was able to endure unperturbed the intense pain of a serious injury to his foot (at S I 27 and S I 110).
7.68	M I 303.

7.71	Dhs 139–45; more explicitly at Abhidh-s 2; cf. also C.A.F. Rhys Davids 1922: p.171 n.2. The discourses offer a somewhat different perspective, since they speak of pleasant and unpleasant sights, sounds, smells, and tastes, these in turn providing the condi￾tions for the arising of corresponding feelings of pleasure or displeasure; cf. e.g. S IV 115; S IV 119; S IV 125; and S IV 126.

8.2	M I 59.
8.3	In addition to these eight categories, the Chinese version of this contemplation in the Madhyama Āgama lists the mind “with blemishes”, and “without blemishes”, while the Ekottara Āgama has “craving” and “mastery of the mind” as additional categories (in Minh Chau 1991: p.93; and Nhat Than 1990: pp.162 and 174). Paṭis II 234 includes the six types of consciousness (differentiated according to the six sense doors) in its list for contemplation of the mind.
8.4	e.g. at M I 495.
8.5	Bodhi 1984: p.98; and Piatigorski 1984: p.41. C.A.F. Rhys Davids 1978: p.8, draws atten￾tion to the novelty of this approach in the history of Indian thought.
8.6	Bullen 1982: p.29.
8.7	Newman 1996: pp.35 and 46. Cf. also A V 39, which explains that while unwholesome conduct by way of body or speech is to be overcome by adopting more appropriate ways of conduct, the proper approach for overcoming mental defilements is repeated wise observation. A clinical case supporting the ingenuity of this approach is docu￾mented by Deatherage 1975: p.140, where a twenty-three-year-old male, hospitalized for extreme periodic aggressiveness and alcohol abuse, was cured within eight weeks simply by being taught to recognize and mentally name the emotions he experi￾enced, without even knowing that what he was doing was related to “meditation”. Another chronic anger case-study involving awareness of mind as cure can be found in Woolfolk 1984: p.551.
8.8	M I 120.
8.9	A V 92; the same simile occurs also at D I 80 and M I 100. Cf. also Samararatne 1997: p.141, who recommends maintaining a “mirror-like mind”, especially in regard to un￾pleasant emotions.
8.10	M I 120.
8.11	The other approaches, in addition to the above-mentioned directing of attention to the nature of these thoughts and to the volitional disposition underlying them, are to direct attention to something wholesome instead, or to reflect on the danger of suc￾cumbing to these unwholesome thoughts, or to try to forget these thoughts. A similar case can be found at A IV 87, where after an extensive list of different methods for staying awake and countering drowsiness, the final recommendation is to go to sleep mindfully. Clearly, in this case too, the last method is not really helpful for staying awake, but is also the last resort when all other measures had failed.
8.12	At M I 242.
8.13	T.W. Rhys Davids 1993: p.266; on the term citta cf. also page 205, footnote 21.
8.14	Taking rāga as a synonym for lobha. A detailed exposition of the three roots can be found in Ñāṇapoṇika 1978.
8.15	Khantipālo 1981: p.38.
8.16	Dhp 251 poetically points out that there is no fire like lust, no grip like anger, and no net like delusion. Buddhadāsa 1989: p.67, suggests distinguishing between mental tendencies such as “pulling in”, “pushing away”, and “running around in circles”, in order to recognize the three unwholesome roots.
8.17	Cf. e.g. M I 5, where arahants are said to be free from these three through their eradica￾tion; M I 65, which refers to realized ascetics as free from lust, anger, and delusion; M I 236 and S I 220, where the Buddha referred to himself as free from lust, anger, and de￾lusion; and A III 43; A III 336; and A III 347, which associate such freedom to absence of the influxes.
8.18	Cf. e.g. A IV 404, where awareness of their absence is part of the reviewing knowledge of an arahant.
8.19	Alternatively, in order to conform with the pattern in this satipaṭṭhāna of presenting a positive state of mind together with its negative counterpart, the contracted (saṅkhitta) state of mind could be taken in a positive sense, as a “concentrated” or “at￾tentive” state of mind (cf. T.W. Rhys Davids 1993: p.665). The corresponding verb saṅkhipati does indeed occur in this positive sense at Ja I 82, when the Buddha radi￾ated loving kindness to his five earlier followers on their first meeting after his awak￾ening. Cf. also Gethin 1992: p.46, who translates saṅkhitta as “composed”, and Goenka 1999: p.57, who translates saṅkhitta as “collected” and “concentrated.”
8.20	S V 279. The relation of these two to “internal” and “external” occurs again at A IV 32.
8.21	Ps I 280. However, in the above mentioned discourse at S V 279 the hindrance restless￾ness occurs separately, apparently not forming part of “distracted”, whereas accord￾ing to the commentarial explanation the two should be identical. The relation of “distracted” to the search for sense gratification (as at S V 279) occurs also at M III 225. The consequences of a distracted state of mind are, according to A V 147, that one be￾comes unable to direct one’s attention skilfully, avoid unwholesome behaviour, or overcome mental inertia.
8.22	e.g. at M II 207.
8.23	M III 146. The commentary Ps IV 200 explains this pervasion to be related to kasiṇa meditation. A kasiṇa is a meditation device, for example a coloured disk, used to help develop concentration.
8.24	Ps I 280.
8.25	Ps I 280 explains “unsurpassable” to refer to absorption attainment. Sīlananda 1990: p.94, takes “unsurpassable” as a specific reference to the immaterial attainments.
8.26	The need to abandon lower absorption attainments is described e.g. at M I 455. Nhat Hanh 1990: p.13, renders sa-uttara with the expression: “my mind is capable of reach￾ing a higher state”.
8.27	e.g. at M I 357. The fourth jhāna as a level of concentration is indeed “unsurpassable”, since the immaterial attainments take place with the same level of concentration, but directed towards progressively more refined objects.
8.28	e.g. at D II 83; M I 163; M I 303; M II 237; S I 105; S I 124; A I 168; A III 435; and Th 415.
8.29	Ps I 280.
8.30	e.g. at M I 141; S III 45; S III 51; Ud 24; and It 33.
8.31	The standard descriptions of full awakening use the expression “liberated” to describe the arahant‘s knowledge of his or her realization (e.g. at D I 84). At times the expression “liberated” is combined with “unsurpassable” as references to full awak￾ening, cf. e.g. M I 235; S I 105; or A IV 106. D III 270 and A V 31 relate the “well liberated mind” to freedom from the three unwholesome roots.
8.32	Ps I 280. This suggestion by the commentary can claim some support from S V 157, which speaks of a calm and undistracted state of mind, fit for satipaṭṭhāna, as “liberated”.
8.33	Various types of “freedom of the mind” are listed at M I 296. Similarly, A III 16 refers to the absence of the five hindrances as a mind “liberated” from them.
8.34	Of the sixty-two grounds for views presented in the Brahmajāla Sutta (D I 12–39), forty-nine appear to be related to concentrative attainments of various types: recol￾lection of past lives [nos 1–3, 5–7, 17]; the divine eye [31–4, 51–7];  kasiṇa meditation [9–11, 19, 23–5, 29–30, 35, 39–41, 43, 47–9]; and jhāna in general [20–2, 27, 36–8, 44–6,59–62]; (correlations given with the help of the commentary). This ratio (nearly 80%) constitutes an overwhelming testimony to the view-generating propensity of deep concentration experiences. The fact that jhānic experiences can easily lead to the for￾mation of wrong views is also noted by Wijebandara 1993: p.21.
8.35	Piatigorski 1984: p.44: “in early historical Buddhism some non-Buddhist yogic experi￾ences were realized, analysed and reworked so that they could be used without their previous or actual religious contents”. Premasiri 1987b: p.178: “the distinctive feature of Buddhism is that it described these jhāna states purely in psychological terms, with￾out bringing in mystical or supernatural explanations for them.”
8.36	M I 350. Cf. also M I 436, which analyses jhānic experience with the help of the aggre￾gate scheme, followed by the consideration that all these phenomena are imperma￾nent, unsatisfactory, and not-self.
8.37	M I 60: “he abides contemplating the nature of arising … of passing away … of both arising and passing away in regard to the mind.”
9.1	Ṭhānissaro 1996: p.73. Paṭis II 234 simply suggests that whatever is not included in the previous three satipaṭṭhānas is to be understood as dhammas in this context. Sīlananda 1990: p.95, rejects a translation as “mental objects” and suggests leaving dhammas un￾translated, a suggestion which I have followed.  Alternative translations could be: “facts in general” (in Kalupahana 1992: p.74); “phenomena” (in Bodhi 2000: p.44, and in Jayasuriya 1988: p.161); “patterns of events” (in Harvey 1997: p.354); “conditions” (in Vajirañāṇa 1975: p.59); or “principles” (in Watanabe 1983: p.16).
9.2	Ñāṇamoli 1995: p.1193 n.157 explains: “in this context dhammā can be understood as comprising all phenomena classified by way of the categories of the Dhamma, the Buddha’s teaching”. Gyori 1996: p.24, in regard to contemplation of dhammas suggests that “the exercises … in this section are specifically intended to invest the mind with a soteriological orientation”.
9.3	In this context it is noticeable that the instruction for contemplation of dhammas em￾ploys the locative case twice, once for dhammas and again for the five hindrances, the five aggregates, etc. Thus one is to “contemplate dhammas in regard to dhammas in re￾gard to the five hindrances, (etc.)”, that is, one contemplates phenomena “in terms of” he categories listed as dhammas. This way of introducing each contemplation differs from the earlier three satipaṭṭhānas. Cf. also S V 184, according to which the dhammas contemplated in this satipaṭṭhāna are conditionally related to attention, while body is related to nutriment, feelings to contact, and mind to name-and-form. This suggests that contemplation of dhammas requires the deliberate act of directing attention to its objects, in terms of the dhammas listed, to a stronger degree than the other satipaṭ- ṭhānas. Carrithers 1983: p.229, explains that “the propositions of doctrine are trans￾muted into immediate perception, here and now”. Similarly Gombrich 1996: p.36, speaks of learning “to see the world through Buddhist spectacles”; while Gyatso 1992: p.8, suggests: “previously learned categories and skills inform present experience without being recollected as such”. Cf. also Collins 1994: p.78.

9.7	Cf. page 69.
9.8	Ps-pṭ I 373.
9.9	At M III 87. Cf. also Paṭis I 191, which relates contemplation of impermanence to expe￾riencing the rise and fall of the aggregates and sense-spheres, thereby providing an additional relation to the satipaṭṭhāna context.
9.10	Although these two contemplations would not necessarily have to be practised in this order, it seems meaningful to follow an inquiry into subjective personality with an in￾vestigation of its relationship to the external world by way of the senses.
9.11	With this presentation I do not intend to suggest that these contemplations of dhammas necessarily have to be practised in this order and in conjunction, only that they are presented in a progressive order in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta.
9.12	Cf. M I 251, where the same four-step sequence, in the context of contemplating feel￾ings, leads directly to realization. Paṭis I 194 explains contemplation of letting go to be of two types: “giving up” (the aggregates) and “leaping forward” (to realization). On “letting go” cf. also Ñāṇārāma 1997: pp.85–7; and van Zeyst 1961a: p.3. The Chinese Saṃyukta Āgama has preserved a different sequence for the last four steps of mindful￾ness of breathing, which proceeds from impermanence to “abandoning”, followed by “fading away” and then culminates with “cessation” (in Choong 2000: p.227).
9.13	M I 190.
9.14	Cf. page 111.
9.15	D III 102 speaks of Nibbāna as the highest of all wholesome dhammas; cf. also A II 34 and Sn 225.
9.16	M I 60.
9.17	Cf. e.g. D I 246; S V 96; and S V 97.
9.18	M II 203; S V 92; S V 127; and A III 63.
9.19	A III 317 and A III 321.
9.20	At S V 110 a tenfold presentation is given, by distinguishing between internal sensual desire, aversion, and doubt, and their external counterparts, while the remaining two compounds are separated into sloth, torpor, restlessness, and worry. This presenta￾tion supports the notion of seven actual mental qualities. Cf. also Gunaratana 1996: p.32. A variation of the usual fivefold presentation can be found at It 8, which has a single hindrance, the hindrance of ignorance. Another variation occurs at Paṭis I 31, Paṭis I 103, and Paṭis I 163, where enumerations of the hindrances omit worry and give ignorance and dissatisfaction instead.
9.21	The similarity between sloth and torpor is noted by Vibh 254, according to which both refer to “inability” or “unreadiness”, with the difference that sloth is of a mental type, while torpor represents the bodily variation. Vibh-a 369 understands this explanation in the case of torpor to refer to mental factors, not to the physical body. But if one con￾siders the antidotes listed for torpor at A IV 85 it becomes probable that to speak of “torpor” does refer to physical torpor. The similarity of the other two hindrances is mentioned at Ps-pṭ I 375.
9.22	Vism 141 explains that concentration is incompatible with sensual desire, joy with aversion, initial mental application with sloth-and-torpor, happiness with restless￾ness-and-worry, and sustained mental application with doubt. (On this correlation cf. also Buddhadāsa 1976: p.112; and Upali Karunaratne 1996: p.51.) The point that Vism is trying to make here could be, in the case of the first four correlations, that uni￾fication of the mind through concentration is opposed to the mental diversification caused by sensual desire, that the mental bliss and physical ease caused by the arising of joy is incompatible with the mental rigidity and physical tension of aversion, that the clear grasp of the object through initial mental application counteracts the unclarity and mental fogginess of sloth-and-torpor, and that the mental contentment and physical tranquillity engendered by happiness does not leave scope for restless￾ness or worry to arise (cf. Vism-mhṭ I 165). As for the fifth hindrance, if doubt (vicikicchā) is understood more broadly, implying not only doubt but a generally dis￾tracted state of mind (cf. T.W. Rhys Davids 1993: p.615, where the corresponding verb vicikicchati is related to being distracted in thought), this would then find its counter￾balance in the mental stability and undistractedness produced by sustained mental application. On the other hand, it should be pointed out that in the discourses a list￾ing of the hindrances and the individual jhāna factors together occurs only at M I 294. This passage does not directly relate each hindrance to an individual jhāna factor, but merely enumerates both, and that in a sequence not corresponding to the commentarial correlation. This passage is moreover absent from the Chinese version of this discourse (cf. Minh Chau 1991: p.100, and Stuart-Fox 1989: p.90), which other￾wise corresponds to the Pāli version. For a critical discussion of the jhāna factor analy￾sis cf. also Rahula 1962: p.192.
9.23	This is especially the case for sloth-and-torpor versus energy; restlessness-and-worry versus tranquillity; and doubt versus investigation-of-dhammas(e.g. at S V 104). In nu￾merous instances throughout the Bojjhaṅga Saṃyutta (S V 63–140) the awakening fac￾tors and the hindrances are presented as diametrically opposed mental qualities. Cf. also page 239.
9.24	A V 195. D II 83; D III 101; and S V 161 stipulate the same conditions for becoming a Buddha.
9.25	S V 121 and A III 230.
9.26	Cf. also Fryba 1989: p.202, who suggests the following correlations: sensual desire dis￾torts perception and fragments awareness, aversion creates divisions and cramps the mind, sloth-and-torpor befogs awareness, restlessness-and-worry consumes the mind with no sense of direction, doubt creates irresolute vacillation.

9.32	This function of satipaṭṭhāna as a middle path between sense indulgence and self￾mortification is mentioned at A I 295.
9.33	Several of these episodes can be found in the Māra and Bhikkhuṇī Saṃyuttas,SI 103–35; cf. also the injunction at Sn 967 to recognize mental defilements as manifesta￾tions of Māra, the “dark one”. Goldstein 1994: p.85, illustratively speaks of “wagging the finger at Māra”. Cf. also Marasinghe 1974: p.197.
9.34	Lily de Silva (n.d.): p.25.
9.35	A study with the help of Rorschach testing corroborates this, where Brown 1986b: p.189, comes to the conclusion that advanced meditators are not without the experi￾ence of conflict, but are remarkably non-defensive in experiencing such conflicts. This observation points to their ability to maintain non-reactive and equanimous awareness.
9.36	Goldstein 1985: p.57: “often there is a tendency to condemn the hindrances when they arise. The condemning mind is itself the factor of aversion.”
9.37	Complete eradication of all five hindrances takes place only with full awakening (cf. S V 327). In fact, when commenting on this part of the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, Ps I 282 corre￾lates the “future non-arising” of each hindrance with corresponding levels of realiza￾tion, these being in most cases non-returning or arahantship.
9.38	e.g. at D I 73. The use of the Pāli verb sam-anupassati in this instruction indicates that a form of contemplation (anupassanā) is intended here.
9.39	S V 92; A I 10; A I 257; and A III 16. These passages relate the luminosity of the mind to the development of a concentrated state of mind that is free from defilements and ready for realization. Cf. also D III 223, where a form of concentration leads to a mind full of “radiance” (sappabhāsa); M III 243, where “luminous” is related to a high level of equanimity; and S V 283, where even the Buddha’s body is said to be “luminous” as a result of concentration. Upali Karunaratne 1999c: p.219, explains: “what is meant by lustrous and pure mind (pabhassara) is not a state of mind which is absolutely pure, nor the pure mind which is synonymous with emancipation … pure only in the sense, and to the extent, that it is not disturbed or influenced by external stimuli”.
9.40	A I 10. The commentaries Mp I 60 and As 140 identify the luminous mind with the bhavaṅga (subconscious life-continuum). Here it could, however, be objected that the term bhavaṅga in the context of the commentarial description of mental processes re￾fers to a subconscious moment that occurs between each conscious part of the mental process. (In fact, sleep is referred to as bhavaṅgaṃ otāreti at Ps-pṭ I 364.) In contrast, the luminous state of mind at A I 10 clearly refers to a conscious experience, since it is to be “known” (pajānāti). On bhavaṅga cf. the excellent exposition in Gethin 1994; also Harvey 1989: pp.94–8; and Sarachchandra 1994: p.90. The attempt by Wijesekera 1976: p.348, to establish a historically early existence of the term with the help of a pas￾sage from the Aṅguttara Nikāya and several occurrences in the Paṭṭhāna is not convinc￾ing, as A II 79 in the pts, the Burmese, and the Sinhalese editions invariably reads bhavagga (best of existences, which also fits the context much better) instead of bhavaṅga, and occurrences in the Paṭṭhāna could also be taken as betraying the com￾paratively late age of this part of the Abhidhamma; cf. also Ñāṇatiloka 1988: p.246.

9.47	A IV 57; on this passage cf. Lily de Silva 1978: p.126.
9.48	e.g. at D III 133. The eradication of sensual desire has already taken place at the level of non-returning.
9.49	Th 1224–5 explains that a distorted cognition of sensuality can be counterbalanced by avoiding sensually alluring objects, by directing attention to the unattractive aspects of the body, by mindfulness of the body (in general), and by developing disenchant￾ment.
9.50	A IV 166. At S IV 110 monks are encouraged to look on women as if they are their own mother, sister, or daughter. The same discourse (at S IV 112) documents the particular importance of sense-restraint, since out of the various methods mentioned for coun￾tering sensual desire, sense-restraint turned out to be the only acceptable explanation for the ability of even young monks to live in celibacy.
9.51	A III 186.
9.52	These come at A III 185 as part of altogether five antidotes: developing loving kind￾ness, compassion, equanimity, inattention, and reflecting on karma.
9.53	M I 424. According to Fenner 1987: p.226, the divine abodes (brahmavihāras) are based on accurate cognitions and thus counter errant cognitions leading to unwholesome mental qualities. An inspiring description of loving kindness can be found in Ñāṇapoṇika 1993: pp.9–12.
9.54	S II 264.
9.55	In fact, at S II 265, non-human beings are apparently set on creating psychological dis￾orders, which can be prevented by developing loving kindness. Katz 1989: p.161, sug￾gests: “one possible interpretation of ‘non-human beings’ could be those psychological functions which endanger spiritual growth”.
9.56	M I 352 describes in detail how to combine loving kindness with insight: on emer￾gence from an absorption developed through loving kindness, one develops insight into the impermanent and conditioned nature of this attainment. M I 38 and A I 196 describe the transition from loving kindness to insight with the reflection: “there is this, there is what is inferior, there is what is superior, and there is a complete escape from this entire field of cognition”. (Ps I 176 and Mp II 306 explain the last to be a refer￾ence to Nibbāna.) Cf. also A IV 150 and It 21, who point out that the development of loving kindness helps to weaken the fetters. According to Aronson 1986: p.51: “the meditation on love is the soil within which concentration and … insight are culti￾vated”. Meier 1978: p.213, suggests that both vipassanā and loving kindness meditation have a similar aim, namely, to weaken the sense of “I”, so that their different approaches (vipassanā by way of analytical dissection, loving kindness by way of expansion) can be considered complementary (though it should be kept in mind that loving kindness on its own will not be able completely to remove all attachment to a sense of “I”).
9.57	At S V 119 the Buddha pointed out that this combination formed the distinguishing feature between the Buddhist approach and the way loving kindness was practised by contemporary ascetics. When considering the Buddha’s way of teaching loving kindness meditation it might also be of relevance to point out that what he originally taught was an unspecified pervasion of all directions with an attitude of loving kind￾ness (cf. e.g. M I 38). D I 251, M II 207, and S IV 322 make the spatially pervasive charac￾ter of radiating loving kindness all the more evident by comparing it to a vigorous trumpeter making himself heard in all four directions. Although such pervasion often indicates absorption, this is not invariably the case, since according to M I 129 this per￾vasion is to be undertaken when being verbally insulted or even physically mal￾treated, a situation hardly conducive to entering absorption. Or else at M II 195 a Brahmin on his deathbed, suffering from agonizing headaches, severe stomach cramps, and high fever, soon after being instructed to practise this pervasion, passed away and was reborn in the Brahmā world. This circumstance suggests that he must have been able to put the instructions to good use, even though his physical condi￾tion would have made it impossible for him to develop absorption. It is only with the commentaries, possibly because they associated the pervasion exclusively with absorption (cf. Vism 308), that meditation on loving kindness becomes an exercise in conceptual imagination, directed towards oneself, a friend, a neutral person, and an enemy in turn (cf. Vism 296). This method of practice is not found anywhere in the discourses.
9.58	S V 131 and A V 300. (This is in both instances repeated for the other three brahma￾vihāras.) Similarly, Sn 143 describes the practice of loving kindness based on “having experienced that state of peace”, with the result that the practitioner will not be born again in a womb (Sn 152). This suggests that the practice of loving kindness can lead one who has experienced the “state of peace”, i.e. one who is a stream-enterer, to tran￾scending rebirth in a womb, i.e. to non-returning. This way of understanding is sup￾ported by the commentary, Pj II 193, which explains “state of peace” to refer to Nibbāna. This explanation is also confirmed by Dhp 368, where loving kindness is again related to “state of peace”, the connotation of which is further clarified by the expression “calming of formations”. However, Jayawickrama 1948: vol.2, p.98, argues against taking “state of peace” to refer to a realization of Nibbāna. The Sanskrit frag￾ments from the Turfan discoveries also mention the realization of non-returning as one of the advantages of developing loving kindness (in Schlingloff 1964: p.133). The reason loving kindness is linked to progress from stream-entry to non-returning could be related to the two fetters that are to be removed at this stage: sensual desire and aversion. Loving kindness, especially if developed up to absorption level, can act as an antidote to both, since the intense mental happiness experienced during deep concentration counteracts the search for pleasure through the external senses, while loving kindness, by its very nature, counters aversion.
9.59	e.g. at D I 71.
9.60	A IV 86 relates “clarity of cognition” to developing a radiant mind. Vibh 254 explains that “clarity of cognition” refers to bright, clear, and pure cognitions, which Vibh-a 369 explains as cognitions free from the hindrances.

9.69	Cf. e.g. Vin III 19, where the monk Sudinna experienced worry due to having en￾gaged in sexual intercourse.
9.70	e.g. at S IV 46 the Buddha, visiting a sick monk, enquired whether that monk had any worries. His question was in the first instance related to “guilt”, but once the sick monk in question reported that he had nothing to reproach himself for, the question was repeated and led to some clarification or specific instruction concerning the Dhamma. Another nuance of “worry” can be found at A I 282, where it indicates exces￾sive worry about realization. Cf. furthermore A II 157, which also relates “restlessness” o the Dhamma.
9.71	D III 49. Such doubt can occur “internally”, in relation to oneself, or “externally”, in relation to others (cf. S V 110).
9.72	A V 147. Cf. also D II 283, where a detailed exposition of wholesomeness and unwhole￾someness from different perspectives enabled Sakka to fully overcome doubt and realize stream-entry.
9.73	M III 158, where doubt is mentioned as the first of a particular set of mental obstruc￾tions not encountered as such elsewhere in the discourses, and which are specifically related to the development of concentration. It is particularly noticeable that the hin￾drances of sensual desire and aversion are not mentioned, suggesting that these have been overcome before the stage of practice in question. The mental obstructions listed are doubt, inattention, sloth-and-torpor, consternation, elation, unease, excessive en￾ergy, deficient energy, longing, cognition of diversity, and excessive meditation on forms. Their successful removal then leads to the attainment of absorption.
9.74	This is suggested by the fact that the nutriment for investigation-of-dhammas is pre￾sented in exactly the same terms as the “anti”-nutriment of doubt, cf. S V 104 and S V 106.
9.75	This simile occurs at M I 453 in relation to dispelling attachment; at M III 300 in rela￾tion to dispelling likes and dislikes that have arisen in the mind; and at S IV 190 in rela￾tion to dispelling unwholesome thoughts and memories.

10.2	S III 27.
10.3	A V 52. Cf. also S III 19–25, where several discourses relate an understanding of the aggregates to full realization.
10.4	At M III 20, a detailed exposition on the aggregates led sixty monks to full realization. At S III 68, the Buddha’s first five disciples became arahants after an exposition of anattā, again by way of the five aggregates. Cf. also Th 87; Th 90; Th 120; Th 161; Th 369; and Th 440; each relating full awakening to insight into the five aggregates.
10.5	e.g. at D II 305. The expression “five aggregates” seems to have been easily intelligible in ancient India, since it occurs in the Buddha’s first discourse, at S V 421, apparently without any need for elaboration or explanation. Similarly, at M I 228, the five aggre￾gates form part of a description of the Buddha’s teaching to the disputer Saccaka (who was presumably unfamiliar with Buddhism, but appears to have readily under￾stood what was being said). This suggests that the five- aggregate scheme might have already been in existence at the time of Gotama Buddha. Since the discourses also in￾clude contemplation of the five aggregates in their description of the awakening of the ancient Buddha Vipassī (at D II 35), it seems that from their perspective, too, the scheme of the five aggregates was known before the advent of Gotama Buddha. Stcherbatsky 1994: p.71, mentions parallels to the aggregates in the Brāhmaṇas and Upaniëads; and according to Warder 1956: p.49 n.2, the aggregates were a known con￾cept among the Jains and possibly also among the Ājīvikas. knowing the impermanent nature of each aggregate stage 2
10.6	e.g. at M III 16. On the term “aggregate” cf. also Boisvert 1997: p.16; Upali Karunaratne 1999b: p.194; and Ñāṇamoli 1978: p.329. C.A.F. Rhys Davids 1937: p.410, suggests that the reason it should be five aggregates in particular could be related to the fact that the number five represents a comprehensive unit in ancient Indian thought, some￾thing which in turn is derived from the number of fingers on the human hand. The range of applicability of the five-aggregate scheme is documented at M I 435, which applies the five-aggregate structure to the experience of jhāna. Cf. also M I 190, which analyses the sense-spheres with the help of the five-aggregate scheme. Khanti 1984: p.49, applies the five aggregates to mindfulness of breathing, by distinguishing be￾tween breath, sensation of breathing, noting in/out-breath, effort to breathe, and knowing the breath.
10.7	M I 300; M III 16; S III 47; and S III 167. Cf. also Ayya Khema 1984: p.8; and Bodhi 1976: p.92.
10.8	As an abridged statement of the first noble truth, e.g. at D II 305: “in short, the five ag￾gregates of clinging are dukkha”. Similarly, S III 7 points out that lust and desire in re￾gard to the five aggregates leads to dukkha; and S III 31 explains that to delight in the five aggregates is to delight in dukkha. Cf. also Gethin 1986: p.41.
10.9	Stcherbatsky 1994: p.23.
10.10	e.g. at M III 17. Such definitions in the discourses also speak frequently of the material form “derived” (upādāya) from the four elements (e.g. at M I 53). Judging from M I 421, this expression might simply refer to those bodily parts or processes that are predomi￾nantly “derived” (upādiṇṇa) from the respective element, such as the harder bodily parts like hair and bones in the case of the element earth, the liquid bodily parts like blood and urine in the case of the element water, the process of digestion in the case of the element fire, and the breath in the case of the element air. According to the Abhidhamma and the commentaries, however, “derived” material form refers to twenty-three or twenty-four types of secondary matter, in addition to the four ele￾ments (twenty-three types at Dhs 134; twenty-four at Vism 444 by adding the heart￾base). A detailed survey of these can be found in Bodhi 1993: pp.235–42; and Karunadasa 1989: pp.31–116. According to Kor 1993: p.6, from the viewpoint of practi￾cal meditation an understanding of the four elements as exemplifying basic charac￾teristics of matter suffices for the development of insight. Cf. also Ñāṇavīra 1987: p.102, who warns against analysis carried out for its own sake.
10.11	S III 86. Strictly speaking, ruppati and rûpa are not etymologically related. Neverthe￾less, this passage offers an illustrative explanation of the term. Kalupahana 1992: p.17, comments: “rûpa … the definition of it provided by the Buddha makes it a function rather than an entity”. Sarachchandra 1994: p.103, explains: “rûpa is not interpreted as mere matter, but as organic sensations” (i.e. as a subjective factor).
10.12	Padmasiri de Silva 1991: p.17; and W.S. Karunaratne 1988a: p.96.
10.13	M I 111: “with contact as condition there is feeling, what one feels, that one cognizes”. M I 293 clarifies that feeling and cognition occur as a conjoined pair. M III 17 points out that contact is the condition for the manifestation of the aggregates of feeling and cognition.
10.14	The standard descriptions (e.g. at D II 309) speak of “eye-contact feeling” and of “cog￾nition of visible form” (the same applies to the other senses); cf. Hamilton 1996: p.15.
10.15	S III 87. Cf. also Boisvert 1997: p.89; Hamilton 1996: pp.54, 57–9; Harvey 1995: p.141 (whose suggested translation of saññā as “cognition” I have followed); Premasiri 1987a: pp.53–5; and C.A.F. Rhys Davids 1922: p.6 n.4. Cf. also Gruber 1999: p.192, who suggests that the prefix saæ- of saññā could be taken to refer to the gathering “together” of sense experiences under a conceptual label through the activity of cognition.
10.16	Cf. D I 93, where “to cognize” (sañjānāti) is used in the sense of “giving a name”; or M III 234 where “cognition” occurs for the various terms used to refer to a bowl. On the relation of cognition to memory cf. Ñāṇapoṇika 1985: p.71.
10.17	e.g. M I 389 distinguished between afflictive and non-afflictive volitions by way of body, speech, and mind. S III 60 and S III 63 explain “volitions” to comprise intentions related to visible form, sound, smell, taste, touch, and mental objects. Cf. also Padmasiri de Silva 1992a: p.16; and Schumann 1957: p.90.
10.18	Ñāṇavīra 1987: p.70, aptly brings out the nature of “volition” by providing the follow￾ing example for the five aggregates: a solid (material form) pleasant (feeling) shady tree (cognition) “for lying under” (volition) visible to me (consciousness).
10.19	S III 87; (cf. also Vibh 7). Bodhi 2000: p.1071 n.112, comments: “this passage shows the active role of … volition in constructing experienced reality. Not only does volition in￾fluence the objective content of the experience, but it also shapes the psychophysical organism within which it has arisen and, via its role as kamma, shapes the future con￾figurations of the five aggregates to be produced by kamma.”
10.20	Cf. the long list of mental factors given under saṅkhārā in Dhs (e.g. 17–18) each time a state of mind is presented; also at Vism 462–72. Cf. also Bodhi 2000: p.45; W.S. Karunaratne 1988a: p.118; McGovern 1979: p.87; C.A.F. Rhys Davids 1978: p.324; and Stcherbatsky 1994: p.20.
10.21	A typical instance is the expression “this body with consciousness” (saviññāṇake kāye), e.g. at S III 80, where “consciousness” stands for all four mental aggregates. Cf. also D I .21 and S II 94, which use “consciousness” (viññāṇa) on a par with the two Pāli terms citta and mano, all three referring to “mind” in this context. Bodhi 2000: p.769 n.154, aptly clarifies the implications of these three Pāli terms in the discourses: “viññāṇa sig￾nifies the particularizing awareness through a sense faculty … as well as the underly￾ing stream of consciousness, which sustains personal continuity through a single life and threads together successive lives.… Mano serves as the third door of action (along with body and speech) and as the sixth internal sense base.… Citta signifies mind as the centre of personal experience, as the subject of thought, volition, and emotion.” A detailed survey of differences in the usage of these three terms in the discourses can be found in Johansson 1965: p.208.
10.22	M I 292 explains that “feeling” just feels, whereas “consciousness” is conscious “of” uch a feeling. S III 87 alternatively illustrates the activity of consciousness by it being conscious of various tastes. Cf. also Hamilton 1996: pp.54 and 92; Harvey 1995: p.154; Premasiri 1987a: p.57; Wayman 1976: p.331; and Wijesekera 1994: pp.87, 104, and 111. Concerning the difference between cognition and consciousness, Ñāṇamoli 1978: p.338 explains: “a hint of what is referred to may perhaps be got from the prefixes …the prefix vi- might be taken dissociatively as the division and distribution of bare (vi-)ññāṇa over the six bases, while the prefix saṃ- might be taken associatively as the perception of synthesis of the objective fields into ‘things’ and ‘percepts’ in each of the six pairs of bases.”
10.23	Cf. the wrong view at M I 258 that the same consciousness feels, experiences karmic retribution, and fares on in the round of rebirths.
10.24	The importance of this conditional interrelation is highlighted at D II 34 and S II 105, where Buddha Vipassī and Buddha Gotama respectively (both still at the bodhisatta stage at this point), on investigating dependent co-arising up to this reciprocal rela￾tionship between consciousness and name-and-form, concluded: “I have found the path of insight leading to awakening.”
10.25	D II 56: “Consciousness conditions name-and-form … name-and-form conditions consciousness.” (“Name”, according to M I 53, comprises feeling, cognition, volition, contact, and attention.)
10.26	S III 142; with further explanations in Vism 479. On these similes cf. also Mahasi 1996: pp.68–79.
10.27	On the relevance of the five aggregates as a philosophical refutation of notions of self cf. Kalupahana 1975: p.116; Thiṭṭila 1969: p.xxii; and Wijesekera 1994: p.262.
10.28	According to Basham 1951: p.270, the Ājīvika soul had the colour of a blue fruit and its size reached the height of five hundred yojanas. (A yojana is the ancient Indian meas￾ure for distances and represents the distance that can be covered with one yoke of oxen in a day, approximately seven miles.) Could this description of the soul refer to the sky?

10.33	Kalupahana 1994: p.13.
10.34	A typical example is the position taken by Ajita Kesakambalī (at D I 55) that there are no such things as good and evil deeds, since a human being is nothing more than a combination of the four elements. Along similar lines Pakudha Kaccāyana (at D I 56) proposed human beings to be made up of seven immutable principles, which led him to the conclusion that even cutting off someone’s head with a sword should not be considered killing, but should be reckoned only as inserting the blade in the space in￾tervening between these seven principles. Cf. also Jayatilleke 1980: p.444; and Kalupahana 1975: pp.25–32.
10.35	The importance of considering the anattā teaching in the light of the karma theory is highlighted by Sasaki 1992: pp.32–5.
10.36	W.S. Karunaratne 1988b: p.72: “the teaching of anattā is an … adaptation of the central truth of causality”.
10.37	That it is the very absence of permanence that disqualifies phenomena from being considered “self” becomes evident at M III 282.  The lack of control over the five aggre￾gates, in addition to their impermanent nature, is, according to S III 66, what disquali￾fies them from being “I” or “mine”.  Cf. also M I 231.
10.38	Vism 640 explains that to speak of “not-self” implies not being susceptible to the free exercise of control. Ñāṇavīra 1987: p.70, points out that “attā, ‘self’, is fundamentally a notion of mastery over things”.
10.39	Cf. Epstein 1988: p.65, 1989: p.66; and Hanly 1984: p.254. On Buddhist and Western notions of “self” cf. also West 1991: pp.200–4.
10.40	In fact, as Ps I 251 indicates, even animals are under the influence of self notions, which would certainly not be a philosophical belief.
10.41	e.g. at S III 68, a consideration to be applied to all possible instances of the five aggregates.
10.42	Spk II 98 explains that the notion “this is mine” is related to craving, the notion “I am this” to conceit, and the notion “this is my self” to views. S III 105 points out that the self-image “I am” comes about because of the existence of some form of grasping.
10.43	S IV 197 enjoins thorough investigation of the range of each aggregate, this investiga￾tion forming the basis for the insight that no I or mine can be found.
10.44	A simple device to start this type of practice could be to question oneself: “who?” or “whose?” in regard to any activity or experience. This is in fact suggested by the satipaṭṭhāna commentary at Ps I 251 and Ps I 274; cf. also Khantipālo 1981: p.71.
10.45	Engler 1983: p.33; and Epstein 1990: p.30. An interesting point in this context is sug￾gested by Wayman 1984: p.622, according to whom ātman might refer to “embodi￾ment” in certain Vedic contexts, which further supports relating it to the “representational self”.
10.46	Hamilton 1997: p.281.
10.47	e.g. at M III 17.
10.48	Harvey 1995: p.17, illustrates this difference by distinguishing between “Self” (perma￾nent, substantial, etc.) and “self” (empirical and changing). Ñāṇananda 1993: p.10, aptly sums up: “accept yourself – and reject your self.”
10.49	Lily de Silva 1996: p.4.
10.50	S I 135. This same simile forms part of the introductory dialogue at Mil 25. A modern version can be found in Claxton 1991: p.27. Cf. also Ñāṇavīra 1987: p.46.
10.51	“I” and “mine” are then used simply as conventions by an arahant (cf. S I 14).
10.52	S IV 400.
10.53	Cf. e.g. the mistaken reasoning at M III 19 that if actions are performed by a not-self, what self could be affected by the result of these actions?
10.54	M I 299: “the five aggregates of clinging are called personality”; cf. also Hamilton 1995a: p.54; and Kalupahana 1994: pp.70–2.
10.55	Hamilton 1996: p.xxiv.
10.56	M II 17. In this passage “consciousness” acts as a representative of mind in its entirety. Cf. also M I 260, which comprehensively refers to the entire set of the five aggregates as something that has “come to be” in conditional dependence on nutriment, a way of developing deep insight leading to freedom from doubt and purified view which does not seem to require analysing them separately. Ps II 307 explains that “come to be” refers to the entire set of the five aggregates in this context.
10.57	S II 94.
10.58	This disenchantment is described at M I 511 with the insight that for a long time one has been tricked and cheated by one’s own mind, since when clinging one has been clinging just to these five aggregates.
10.59	Cf. e.g. S II 28, where contemplating the arising and passing away of the five aggre￾gates is immediately followed by an exposition of dependent co-arising (paṭicca samuppāda).
10.60	At D II 35 the former Buddha Vipassī realized full awakening by contemplating the impermanence of the five aggregates. The same contemplation and result by a nun is documented at Thī 96. The potential of this contemplation to lead to full awakening is documented also at D III 223; S II 29; S II 253; A II 45; and A IV 153. Gethin 1992: p.56, concludes: “the practice of watching rise and fall with regard to the five aggregates of grasping seems to be particularly associated with the gaining of the insight that leads … directly to awakening”.

10.67	S III 14.
10.68	M I 191. Cf. also S IV 188, which relates contemplation of the arising and passing away of the aggregates to understanding the arising and passing away of dukkha.
10.69	S III 66 points out that each aggregate is not-self, since it is not possible to have them conform to one’s wishes (such as, for example, always having a healthy body, experi￾encing only pleasant feelings, etc.).
10.70	S III 160 and S III 193.
10.71	S III 167.
11.1	Cf. e.g. M III 279 and S IV 106, which directly relate contemplation of the sense-spheres to the aggregate scheme; cf. also S IV 68. On the contemplations of the aggregates and the senses as complementary approaches cf. Bodhi 2000: p.1122; and Gethin 1986: p.50.
11.2	M I 61.
11.3	S IV 89 and A V 52 present insight and detachment regarding the six sense-spheres as enabling one to make an end of dukkha.
11.4	Cf. Johansson 1965: pp.183–7; and T.W. Rhys Davids 1993: p.520.
11.5	M I 295 and S V 218.
11.6	This has found its expression in various passages such as at M I 122, where to develop mastery of the mind means to be able to think only what one wishes to think; or at M I 214, which speaks of gaining control over the mind and thereby being no longer con￾trolled by it; or Dhp 326, which poetically compares controlling one’s wandering mind to a mahout controlling a rutting elephant.
11.7	e.g. at M I 111.
11.8	Ñāṇamoli 1980: p.159, aptly expresses this: “ajjhattikāyatana = the organization of ex￾perience … bahiddhāyatana = the experience as organized”; van Zeyst 1967b: p.470, ex￾plains: “the inner sphere … constitutes the subjective element which is the capacity of reaction, and the outer sphere constitutes the objective element which produces the impact”. In fact, several of the terms used in this satipaṭṭhāna refer exclusively to the senses as faculties of perception (cakkhu, sota, ghāna), while the discourses use a differ￾ent set of Pāli terms for the corresponding physical organs (akkhi, kaṇṇa, nāsā), a find￾ing which points to an emphasis on the subjective, in the sense of one’s ability to see, hear, etc., underlying the satipaṭṭhāna instructions.
11.9	Cf. e.g. Bodhi 1995: p.16; Padmasiri de Silva 1991: p.21; Guenther 1991: p.16; and Naranjo 1971: p.189.
11.10	S IV 163; S IV 164; and S IV 283. Cf. also S IV 89 and S IV 108.
11.11	M I 361 has eight “fetters” in relation to killing, stealing, false speech, malicious speech, rapacious greed, spiteful scolding, angry despair, and arrogance. D III 254; A IV 7; and A IV 8 list seven: complaisance, irritation, views, doubt, conceit, lust for exis￾tence, and ignorance. Single fetters occur at M I 483, which has the fetter of house￾holdership, and at It 8, which speaks of the fetter of craving.
11.12	Cf. e.g. S V 61. Ps I 287 lists sensual lust, irritation, conceit, view, doubt, clinging to par￾ticular rules and observances, lust for existence, envy, avarice, and ignorance as fetters for the satipaṭṭhāna context. Concerning clinging to particular rules and obser￾vances, Bodhi 2000: p.727 n.5, explains that the expression “rules and observances” (sīlabbata) can refer to such ascetic practices as, for example, behaving like a dog (cf. M I 387, which speaks of the “dog-rule” and the “dog-observance”). Some ascetics adopted such practices in the hope of gaining purification or rebirth in heaven (cf. M I 102). Cf. also Ud 71, where “rules and observances” replaces the more usual “self￾mortification” as one of the two extremes to be avoided. However, at Dhp 271 the Buddha spoke to his own monks about the need to go beyond “rules and obser￾vances” in order to reach realization; so this verse indicates that “rules and obser￾vances” can also become a problem for Buddhist monks. In fact, the equivalent term sīlavata occurs in several instances as a positive quality of a Buddhist monk (e.g. at A III 47; Sn 212; It 79; and Th 12). This suggests, as in fact expressly stated at A I 225, that “rules and observances” can be either wholesome or unwholesome, so the fettering aspect is to be found in dogmatic clinging (parāmāsa). The absence of such dogmatic clinging is indeed explicitly mentioned in the standard descriptions of the qualities of a stream-enterer (cf. e.g. D II 94; S II 70; or A II 57), which indicate that a stream-enterer is endowed with pure moral conduct, but does not dogmatically cling to it. (The Pāli term used is aparāmaṭṭha, which according to Vism 222 refers in this context to clinging by way of craving and views.)
11.13	Cf. e.g. D I 156. The dynamics of this progressive eradication of the ten fetters is that with the first direct experience of Nibbāna at stream-entry, belief in a permanent self becomes impossible. Since this experience comes as the successful outcome of follow￾ing the right path, doubt about what is wholesome and skilful for progress on this path, and also doubt in the more existential sense regarding the whence and whither of oneself, together with dogmatic clinging to particular rules and observances, are left behind. With continued practice, the next two fetters of sensual desire and aver￾sion are diminished at once-returning and then fully overcome with the realization of non-returning. With full awakening, the last remnants of attachment in the form of craving for deep states of concentration (and corresponding forms of existence) are extinguished, together with any traces of the notion “I am” as a manifestation of con￾ceit and its possible repercussions in the form of restlessness, and therewith all igno￾rance is overcome as well.
11.14	A I 264 relates the state of being fettered to desire, this in turn being due to thinking and pondering over desirable things of the past, present, or future. if fetter arises knowing the conditions that lead to arising if fetter is present → knowing the conditions that lead to removal if fetter is removed knowing the conditions that prevent future arising
11.15	M I 111.
11.16	Cf. Ñāṇananda 1986: p.5.
11.17	Sn 874 emphasizes the dependence of conceptual proliferation on cognition in particular.
11.18	M I 108. Cf. also M III 285, which relates a part of the same conditioned perceptual sequence to the activation of the latent tendencies.
11.19	e.g. at A IV 9. Apart from this standard set one finds the latent tendency to mental standpoints and adherences at S II 17 and S III 135, the latent tendency to lust at S IV 205, and the latent tendency to craving at Dhp 338. To contemplate the effects these underlying tendencies can create in the mind may be undertaken by directing aware￾ness to the untrained mind’s “tendency” to react to sensory experience with either lust or irritation; to its “tendency” to respond to more theoretical information by either forming views and opinions or else by feeling confused and doubtful; and by contemplating how the sense of “I” underlying subjective experience “tends” to man￾ifest as conceit and moreover “tends” to clamour for eternal continuation (viz. craving for existence). Contemplating in this way will reveal the surprising degree to which the unawakened mind in some way or other “tends” towards ignorance. Ñāṇapoṇika 1977: p.238, points out that “latent tendency” includes both the actually arisen mental defilement and the corresponding mental disposition, this being the result of long￾time habits.
11.20	M I 432; cf. also M II 24.
11.21	Āsava also means “outflow”, as when a sore festers (cf. A I 124), or “fermentation”, as when liquor is brewed from flowers etc. (cf. Sv III 944).
11.22	e.g. M I 9 recommends guarding the senses in order to avoid the activation of the in￾fluxes.
11.23	M I 7 relates the arising of the influxes to unwise attention; A III 414 to ignorance.
11.24	The rationale given by the Buddha for proclaiming a rule (cf. e.g. Vin III 21) was that it should restrain presently arisen influxes and avoid their arising in future (cf. also M I 445). In addition to adherence to the rules, other important methods for countering the influxes are not getting entangled in wrong views; restraining the senses; using requisites properly; enduring heat, cold, hunger, pain, etc.; avoiding dangerous ani￾mals and unsuitable intimacy with the opposite sex; removing unwholesome inten￾tions and thoughts; and developing the factors of awakening (at M I 7–11).
11.25	e.g. at M I 171.
11.26	e.g. at M I 55. In addition to these three influxes, the influx of views is mentioned in a few instances (e.g. at D II 81); however, according to Ñāṇatiloka 1988: p.27, and T.W. Rhys Davids 1993: p.115, the set of three influxes is probably the more original version. On the influxes cf. also Johansson 1985: p.178; and Premasiri 1990a: p.58.
11.27	e.g. at S V 421.
11.28	This also underlies the fact that descriptions of the actual event of full awakening of￾ten apply the scheme of the four noble truths to dukkha and again to the influxes, cf. e.g. D I 84.
11.29	S V 28.
11.30	The all-pervasive range of craving is illustrated in the detailed exposition of the sec￾ond noble truth in the Mahāsatipaṭṭhāna Sutta, D II 308, where the various stages of the perceptual process, from the six senses, their respective objects and types of con￾sciousness, via contact, to feeling, cognition, volition, and initial and sustained mental application are all listed as possible instances for the arising of craving. This analysis of sense experience occurs again at S II 109, and also at Vibh 101 (in the Suttanta exposi￾tion of the four noble truths).
11.31	Bodhi 2000: p.1127, explains: “to restrain the senses … involves stopping at the bare sensum, without plastering it over with layers of meaning whose origins are purely subjective”. Upali Karunaratne 1993: p.568, relates restraint of the senses in particular to the stage of the perceptual process when feelings arise.
11.32	e.g. at S IV 78. Cf. also M I 346, which speaks of the pure happiness (abyāseka sukha) gained through sense-restraint.
11.33	At M III 298, in answer to a Brahmin who had proposed not seeing with the eyes and not hearing with the ears as a form of meditative development of the faculties. Cf. also Tilakaratne 1993: p.72.
11.34	e.g. at M I 273. The verb “to flow into”, anvāssavati, is derived from anu + ā + savati (T.W. Rhys Davids 1993: p.50) and is thus reminiscent of the influxes, the āsavas.
11.35	e.g. at M I 360 “sign” refers to the outer aspect of being a householder; or at Vin III 15 and M II 62 a slave woman recognized the former son of the house, now a monk and returning after a long absence, by way of the “sign”. In other passages “sign” has a more causal function (cf. e.g. S V 213; A I 82; A II 9; A IV 83; and Th 1100). On “sign” cf. also Harvey 1986: pp.31–3; and page 237, footnote 21.
11.36	A I 3 relates sensual desire to unwise attention to the “sign of beauty”, and aversion to unwise attention to the “sign of irritation”. M I 298 explains that lust, anger, and delu￾sion are “makers of signs”. Cf. also M III 225, which describes how consciousness, be￾cause of following after the sign, becomes tied and shackled by the gratification derived from the sign, and thereby becomes fettered to the sign.
11.37	As 400, however, takes the term to refer to the details of the perceived object. On the other hand, in similar passages in the discourses “sign” may be followed by various types of thoughts, which could correspond to “association” (cf. e.g. M I 119). T.W. Rhys Davids 1993: p.43, translates anuvyañjana as “accompanying attribute”, “supple￾mentary or additional sign or mark”. The corresponding Chinese version (Minh Chau 1991: p.82) speaks of not grasping the general appearance and not “taking delight in it”. On anuvyañjana as “association” cf. Vimalo 1974: p.54.
11.38	A II 167. Cf. also Sn 779, pointing out that by penetrative insight into cognition one will be able to cross the flood; and Sn 847, according to which one gone beyond cognition has thereby gone beyond bondage.
11.39	M I 507 speaks of the cognitive distortion (viparītasaññā) to perceive sensual pleasures as happiness. M II 27 identifies cognitions under the influence of sensuality, aversion, and cruelty as the source of all unwholesome thoughts and intentions.
11.40	These are the four vipallāsas, cf. A II 52; Paṭis II 80; Bodhi 1992b: p.4; and page 25, foot￾note 27.
11.41	Fromm 1960: p.127: “man in the state of repressedness … does not see what exists, but he puts his thought image into things, and sees them in the light of his thought im￾ages and fantasies, rather than in their reality. It is the thought image … that creates his passions, his anxieties.” Johansson 1985: p.96: “things are seen through the lenses of our desires, prejudices and resentments and are transformed accordingly”.
11.42	e.g. at D III 251; D III 253; D III 289; A III 79; A III 83–5; A IV 24; A IV 46; A IV 387; A V 105–7; and A V 109.
11.43	M II 27. In fact, according to D I 185 cognition temporally precedes knowledge (ñāṇa), a temporal precedence which can lead to a considerable degree of influence exercised by cognition on what is being “known”; cf. also Ñāṇavīra 1987: p.110.
11.44	D I 180 explains that through training some type of cognitions will arise, others will disappear (this statement occurs in the context of jhāna attainment); cf. also Premasiri 1972: p.12. Claxton 1991: p.25, points out that “the Buddhist position, because it asserts that perception is changeable by psychological practices such as meditation, assumes a ‘constructivist’ view”.
11.45	A long list of such cognitive trainings is given at A V 107, each time introduced by the expression “accustomed to” or “ familiar with” (paricita). Cf. also Paṭis I 32.
11.46	A V 109.
11.47	M III 301. A III 169 explains that the purpose of this cognitive training is to counter the arising of lust and anger.
11.48	D III 113.
11.49	Cf. S V 295, where an exposition ofsatipaṭṭhāna is followed by a description of the abil￾ity to influence cognition (paṭikkûle appaṭikkûlasaññī). Scientific corroboration of per￾ceptual changes owing to meditation can be found in Brown 1984: p.727. Cf. also Brown 1977: p.248; Deikman 1969: p.204; and Santucci 1979: p.72.
11.50	Ud 8; for this he was noted among the Buddha’s disciples as pre-eminent in quick un￾derstanding (at A I 24). S IV 63 and S V 165 report the realization of a monk by the same name, Bāhiya, but based in one case on contemplating the six senses as impermanent, unsatisfactory, and not-self, and in the other case on satipaṭṭhāna. According to Malalasekera 1995: vol.II, pp.281–3, these last two are different from the Bāhiya of the Udāna episode. Another Bāhiya who caused dissension among the monks is men￾tioned at A II 239. At S IV 73 the monk Māluṅkyaputta received the “Bāhiya” instruc￾tion, where it again led to full awakening, although in this case after a period of practice in seclusion. The Bāhiya case also comes up in the Satipaṭṭhāna subcom￾mentary Ps-pṭ I 357, in the context of clear knowledge in regard to bodily activities.
11.51	Ud 8.
11.52	This seems to be the implication of several passages in the Sutta Nipāta which employ the same terms (seen, heard, sensed), cf. Sn 793; Sn 798; Sn 802; Sn 812; and Sn 914. Mahasi 1992: p.42, explains: “when one concentrates only on the act of seeing without thinking over what one has seen, visual perception will last only for an instant … in that case defilements will have no time to assert themselves”. Namto 1984: p.15: in￾structs one to “focus on the split-second between hearing a sound and recognizing it in the conventional manner”. Practical experiences that reflect the above injunctions are described in Shattock 1970: p.68; and Walsh 1984: p.267.
11.53	Compare the detailed treatment given by Māluṅkyaputta after receiving the “Bāhiya” instructions at S IV 73, where he pointed out how lack of mindfulness leads to giving attention to the sign of affection and thereby to an infatuated state of mind. (Same again in part at Th 98–9 and in full at Th 794–817.)
11.54	M I 1. Cf. also A II 23, which documents the Buddha’s ability to see through and fully understand whatever is seen, heard, sensed, or cognized.
11.55	M III 30.
11.56	M I 136 and M III 261.
11.57	M I 135. Cf. also Bhattacharya 1980: p.10.
11.58	Bòhadāraṇyaka Upaniëad 2.4.5 states that the self should be seen, heard of, thought about, and meditated upon, since by the seeing, hearing, sensing, and cognizing of the self everything is known; Bòhadāraṇyaka Upaniëad 4.5.6 then declares that once the self is seen, heard, sensed, and cognized, everything is known.
11.59	“By that” (tena) in the sense of “thereby”, cf. e.g. Dhp 258, which criticizes much talk￾ing by pointing out that “thereby” or “by that” (tena) one does not become a sage. According to Ireland 1977: p.160 n.3, tena and tattha “are the key words in this text”.
11.60	“Therein”, tattha, is a locative adverb, which can also be translated as “there”, “in that place”, or “to this place” (T.W. Rhys Davids 1993: p.295). Vimalo 1959: p.27, renders this passage (tena + tattha): “then you will not be influenced by that, if you are not in￾fluenced by it, you are not bound to it”. For “subjective participation” in the sense of affective involvement cf. Sn 1086. Bodhi 1992b: p.13, commenting on the Bāhiya in￾struction, explains: “what is to be eliminated from cognition is precisely the false im￾putations of subjectivity that distort the incoming data and issue in erroneous judgements and beliefs”.
11.61	Following Ñāṇavīra 1987: p.435. The commentary Ud-a 92, however, relates these ex￾pressions to spheres of rebirth, but points out that in this interpretation “in between” hould not be taken to refer to an intermediate existence. In fact, the Pāli commentarial tradition holds that rebirth immediately follows the moment of pass￾ing away. A close examination of the discourses, on the other hand, reveals several in￾stances which suggest that from their perspective such a state in between existences did exist, where the being to be reborn (the gandhabba at M I 265 and M II 157), pro￾pelled by craving (S IV 399), seeks a new existence (sambhavesi at M I 48 and Sn 147), or can attain full awakening in that intermediate state if the stage of non-returning had earlier been realized (the antarāparinibbāyi e.g. at D III 237; S V 70; S V 201; S V 204; S V 237; S V 285; S V 314; S V 378; A I 233; A II 134; A IV 14; A IV 71; A IV 146; A IV 380; and A V 120). Cf. also Bodhi 2000: p.1902 n.65.
11.62	A III 400, commenting on Sn 1042. Cf. also Dhp 385, which speaks in praise of going be￾yond this shore and the other, a passage which according to Daw Mya Tin 1990: p.132, can be interpreted in a similar way. The seamstress (craving) occurs again at Th 663. Cf. also Ñāṇananda 1999: p.19.
12.1	S V 72; S V 83; and Paṭis II 115. Cf. also D III 97; Dhp 89; and Thī 21. According to Nor￾man 1997: p.29, bodhi is better rendered by “awakening” than by “enlightenment”, a suggestion which I have followed.
12.2	S V 134.
12.3	M I 61.
12.4	M III 85 and S V 68.
12.5	According to S V 73 and A V 116, the development of the four satipaṭṭhānas fulfils the seven awakening factors. if present knowing the conditions that lead to further development and perfection if absent knowing the conditions that lead to arising
12.6	At S V 115 the Buddha emphatically stated thatsati is always useful. This usefulness of sati is illustratively compared by the commentary to the need for salt when preparing food (at Ps I 292). The central importance ofsati is also brought out at Ps I 243 and Ps-pṭ I 363, according to which sati forms the essential condition for “contemplation” and “knowledge”.
12.7	S V 112.
12.8	At S V 68 “investigation-of-dhammas” refers to further reflection on earlier heard ex￾planations by elder monks. In contrast at S V 111 “investigation-of-dhammas” stands for investigating internal and external phenomena.
12.9	T.W. Rhys Davids 1993: p.616.
12.10	S V 66. On investigation-of-dhammas cf. also Jootla 1983: pp.43–8; and Ledi 1983: p.105, who assembles the five higher stages of purification, the three contemplations, and the ten insight knowledges under this particular awakening factor. According to Mil 83, investigation-of-dhammasis a mental quality of crucial importance for realization.
12.11	Cf. S V 104, which describes the “nutriment” for investigation-of-dhammas in exactly the same terms used by S V 106 to describe the “anti-nutriment” for doubt, namely wise attention in regard to what is wholesome and what is unwholesome. Such clar￾ity is in both cases concerned with “internal” as well as “external” dhammas (cf. S V 110).
12.12	According to Debes 1994: p.292, the effect of investigation-of-dhammas, by finding out the validity and relevance of the Buddha’s teachings to experienced reality, is to awaken energy (“Tatkraft”).
12.13	S V 66 recommends endeavour and exertion as nutriments for the awakening factor of energy. The Chinese Āgama version of this discourse mentions the four right efforts as nutriment for the awakening factor of energy (cf. Choong 2000: p.213). This presen￾tation fits well with the distinction between wholesomeness and unwholesomeness gained through cultivating the previous awakening factor, investigation-of-dhammas, since the same distinction underlies the four right efforts.
12.14	S V 68.
12.15	S V 111. Spk III 169 mentions the practice of walking meditation as an example for physical “energy”.
12.16	S V 104 describes the nutriment for the awakening factor of energy in the same terms used at S V 105 for the anti-nutriment for sloth-and-torpor.
12.17	S V 68 speaks of “unworldly joy”; which S V 111 relates to the presence or absence of initial and sustained mental application, i.e. to the experience of absorption. “Joy” in this context is, however, not confined to jhānic joy only, since non-sensual joy can also be the result of insight meditation, cf. e.g. Dhp 374.
12.18	e.g. at S II 32; cf. also page 166, footnote 45.
12.19	S V 104 identifies physical and mental tranquillity as nutriment for the awakening fac￾tor of tranquillity, while S V 106 speaks of calmness of the mind (cetaso vûpasamo) as anti-nutriment for restlessness-and-worry. Another noteworthy point is that the dis￾courses analyse both the awakening factor tranquillity and the hindrance sloth-and￾torpor into a bodily and a mental aspect, documenting a physical and a psychological component of both.
12.20	S V 69.
12.21	S V 105 recommends the “sign of calmness” (samathanimitta) as nutriment for the awakening factor of concentration. This “sign of calmness” is mentioned again at D III 213 and S V 66. The “sign” (nimitta) occurs also in various other passages, often in ap￾parent relation to the development of concentration. Frequently a “sign of concentra￾tion” (samādhinimitta) can be found (at D III 226; D III 242; D III 279; M I 249; M I 301; M III 112; A I 115; A I 256; A II 17; A III 23; and A III 321). Though at M I 301 this sign of con￾centration is related to the four satipaṭṭhānas, at M III 112 it refers to the practice of samatha meditation, since this passage speaks of internally unifying, quietening, and concentrating the mind on this sign of concentration, which it then explains to refer to attainment of the four jhānas. In some instances one also finds the “sign of the mind” (cittanimitta, e.g. at S V 151; A III 423; and Th 85), which Th 85 relates to non￾sensual happiness, an instance reminiscent of the experience of non-sensual happi￾ness during absorption. Similarly, A IV 419 recommends making much of the “sign”, which in this passage too represents jhānic attainment. Another relevant passage is M III 157, where the Buddha spoke of the need to “penetrate” or “acquire” the sign (nimittaṃ paṭivijjhitabbaṃ) in order to overcome various mental obstructions. The set of mental obstructions to be overcome in this discourse form a unique set which does not occur as such elsewhere and is clearly related to samatha meditation (cf. page 199, footnote 73). Ps IV 207 however, possibly having in mind A IV 302, takes this passage to refer to the divine eye. This reading by the commentary does not make much sense, since the above passage clearly deals with a level of practice prior even to the first jhāna, while to develop the divine eye would necessitate attainment of the fourth jhāna. Shwe 1979: p.387, explains: “anything entering into a causal relation, by which its effect is signified, marked or characterized, is a nimitta. An object, image or concept which, on being meditated upon, induces samādhi (jhāna) is a nimitta.” On the “sign” n a different context cf. also page 225, footnote 35.
12.22	S V 111. As Vism 126 explains, the jhāna factors already begin to arise during access con￾centration, although they become fully stable only with the attainment of the first jhāna. Thus the expression “concentration with initial mental application” can also be taken to include levels of concentration bordering on absorption, during which the presence of initial and sustained mental application is responsible for further deepen￾ing concentration and thereby leads to attainment of the first jhāna. Understood in this way, levels of concentration close to absorption, corresponding to the commentarial notion of “access concentration”, could also be put into service as awakening factors.
12.23	S V 69. Aronson 1979: p.2, explains that upekkhā is formed from upa meaning “toward” nd a derivative of the verb ikkh meaning “to see”, and thus conveys a “notion of over-looking a situation from a distance”. Gethin 1992: p.160, points out that “upekkhā … is both the balance of the skilful mind and the force which maintains that balance”.
12.24	e.g. at M III 88. The same awakening dynamics can be related to the noble eightfold path (S I 88; S IV 367; and S V 1–62); and to the five faculties (S IV 365; S V 239; and S V 241); or the five powers (S IV 366; S V 249; and S V 251); cf. also Gethin 1992: pp.162–8.
12.25	The discourses express this contrast by calling the awakening factors “anti￾hindrances” (anīvaraṇā, e.g. at S V 93). Cf. also page 188, footnote 23. In the Chinese Madhyama Āgama version, contemplation of the awakening factors immediately fol￾lows contemplation of the hindrances in the sequence of the dhamma-contempla￾tions, which illustrates how the removal of the latter naturally leads to a development of the former; cf. Minh Chau 1991: p.94; and Nhat Hanh 1990: p.163.
12.26	S V 128 points out that the awakening factors lead to knowledge and vision, while the hindrances lead to the absence of knowledge and vision.
12.27	According to S V 121 they constitute the reason why at times what has been well learned can be forgotten, while at other times matters not studied intensively can still be well remembered.
12.28	The four noble truths occur in neither of the two Āgama versions and in only one of the three other versions of satipaṭṭhāna, this being the Šāriputrābhidharma (cf. Schmit￾hausen 1976: p.248). The six sense-spheres occur in the Chinese Madhyama Āgama ver￾sion, while the Chinese version found in the Ekottara Āgama has only the awakening factors and, based on removal of the hindrances (mentioned at the outset of the dis￾course), the development of the four jhānas (cf. Nhat Than 1990: p.176).
12.29	Warder 1991: p.86.
12.30	Vibh 199. Ñāṇatiloka 1983: p.39, seems to take this “omission” on the side of the Vibhaṅga as a matter of intentional selection. Cf. also Ṭhānissaro 1996: p.74.
12.31	D II 83; D III 101; and S V 161.
12.32	Cf. S V 129–33.
12.33	S V 71. It is interesting to note that the monk possessing this ability was Sāriputta, who is characterized elsewhere in the discourses for his wisdom (e.g. S I 191, and A I 23) and his ability in mental analysis (M III 25). At M I 215 he used the same simile to illustrate mental mastery.
12.34	S V 77; cf. also S V 99.
12.35	Cf. S V 108 and S V 112; and the commentary at Spk III 168; cf. also Gethin 1992: pp.177–80; and Woodward 1979: vol.V p.91 n.1.
12.36	S V 99 presents both the seven treasures of a Tathāgata, which are the seven awaken￾ing factors, and the seven treasures of a universal monarch, which are a wheel, an ele￾phant, a horse, a jewel, a woman, a steward, and a counsellor, each endowed with magical qualities. Spk III 154 then correlates them individually.
12.37	At S V 79–81, where Kassapa, Moggallāna, and the Buddha were each cured of illness by a recitation of the awakening factors. The effect of thus recalling and probably at the same time also re-establishing the constellation of mental factors that had led each of them to full awakening was apparently powerful enough to effect an abating of their respective diseases. On the curative effect of the awakening factors cf. Dhammananda 1987: p.134; and Piyadassi 1998: pp.2–4. The Chinese Āgamas have only preserved the instance involving the Buddha, not the other two, cf. Akanuma 1990: p.242.
12.38	Ps I 290–9.
13.1	M I 62.
13.2	e.g. at S V 421. Gethin 1992: p.18, comments: “understanding the first noble truth involves not so much the revelation that dukkha exists, as the realization of what dukkha is”. Hamilton 1996: p.206, points out that “the first noble truth … can most ac￾curately be understood if it is borne in mind that this is a truth statement, not a value judgement”.
13.3	S V 441 and M I 118.
13.4	Cf. T.W. Rhys Davids 1993: p.324; and Wijesekera 1994: p.75.
13.5	Monier-Williams 1995: pp.334 (kha) and 483 (duåkha); cf. also Smith 1959: p.109. The corresponding Pāli terms are the prefix du (difficulty, badness), and akkha (axle of a wheel), cf. T.W. Rhys Davids 1993: pp.2 and 324. Vism 494 gives another rather imagi￾native explanation of the term, by relating kha to space (ākāsa), which is then sup￾posed to represent the absence of permanence, beauty, happiness, and self.
13.6	Monier-Williams 1995: p.1262.
13.7	Cf. also Ñāṇamoli 1991: p.823 n.8, who suggests “uneasiness” as a preferable render￾ing for dukkha when this is used as a characteristic of the whole of experience.
13.8	S II 53.
13.9	At D II 66 the Buddha pointed out that when experiencing a pleasant feeling, for ex￾ample, one will not experience the other two types of feeling. Other passages indicate that according to the Buddha certain kinds of experiences and corresponding realms of existence are pure pleasure or happiness, e.g. M I 76 speaks of the experience of en￾tirely pleasant feelings (by beings reborn in heaven), and M II 37 affirms that there is an entirely pleasant world (this being the Brahmā world corresponding to the attain￾ment of the third jhāna). Cf. also Nanayakkara 1993a: p.538.
13.10	S IV 216. M III 208 discusses the same statement. Cf. also Ñāṇamoli 1995: p.1340 n.1227; and Ñāṇavīra 1987: p.477.
13.11	M I 303 points out that whereas the change of pleasurable experiences might be expe￾rienced as suffering, in the case of pain, change is experienced as pleasurable.
13.12	e.g. at S V 421. Cf. also Gruber 1999: pp.94 and 194; and Nanayakkara 1989: p.699.
13.13	In addition to the eightfold enumeration of path factors, a fivefold presentation can occasionally be found that is applicable to the context of meditation and presupposes the previous fulfilment of right speech, right action, and right livelihood, cf. M III 289; Vibh 238–240; the discussion at Kv 600; and Ñāṇatiloka 1983: p.32. A tenfold enumera￾tion also occurs (e.g. at D II 217 and M III 76), which adds qualities of the arahant: right knowledge and right liberation.
13.14	Satipaṭṭhāna as the path factor of right mindfulness is in particular closely related to right view, since on the one hand right mindfulness is required to establish right view (cf. M III 72), while on the other hand, right view serves as a basis for all other path fac￾tors (cf. D II 217 and M I 71). Cf. also Vibh 242, which speaks of right view as the “root” f the other seven path factors. The need for right view as a foundation for progress on the path is also emphasized by Bodhi 1991: p.3; and Story 1965: p.167.
13.15	The same also underlies the nuances of sammā as “togetherness” or as being “con￾nected in one”, cf. page 74.
13.16	S V 422.
13.17	At S V 435. Another discourse at S V 435 offers the alternative explanation that they are so called because their author is the “Noble One”. This discourse, unlike the preced￾ing one, is missing from the Chinese Āgamas, cf. Akanuma 1990: p.263. According to Norman 1984: p.389, the attribute “noble” might not have been part of the historically earliest formulations of the four (noble) truths.
13.18	De la Vallée Poussin 1903: p.580; Padmasiri de Silva 1992a: p.166; and Pande 1957: p.398. According to Wezler 1984: pp.312–24, there is no evidence for this scheme hav￾ing predated the Buddha’s formulation of the four noble truths, therefore it is also possible that it was adopted from his teaching by the medical sciences. Parallels to the four noble truths occur also in the Yoga Sûtra by Patañjali, II 15–26, a detailed discus￾sion of which can be found in Wezler 1984: pp.301–7.
13.19	e.g. at M II 260; A IV 340; It 101; Sn 560; Sn 562; and Th 1111. A III 238 explains that just as a skilled doctor can quickly dispel one’s disease, so too the Buddha’s teaching will dis￾pel all one’s sorrow and grief. Cf. also Ehara 1995: p.275; and Vism 512.
13.20	Buswell 1994: p.3, speaks of early Buddhism’s “spiritual pragmatism according to which the truth of a religious proposition consists in its practical utility”.
13.21	M I 184.
13.22	S V 452.
13.23	S V 436.
13.24	S V 52 and A II 247. S III 159 and S III 191 explain that to “understand” the five aggre￾gates implies the eradication of lust, anger, and delusion.
13.25	Sn (prose preceding verse 724).
13.26	The standard formulations of the first noble truth identify “not getting what one wants” as one of the aspects of dukkha, e.g. at S V 421.
13.27	S I 4 and S I 7 use this expression to illustrate the inner balance and flexibility of arahants.
13.28	S IV 86 applies the scheme of the four noble truths to an understanding of the six sense-spheres (cf. also S V 426); while M I 191 and S V 425 do the same in regard to the aggregates.  In the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta itself, the contemplations of the hindrances and of the awakening factors are structured according to an underlying pattern that par￾allels the diagnostic scheme of the four noble truths, since each observation turns to the presence of the respective mental quality, its absence, and the causes of its pres￾ence or absence.
13.29	The scheme of the four noble truths is applied at Ps I 250 to mindfulness of breathing, at Ps I 252 to the four postures, at Ps I 270 to activities, at Ps I 271 to anatomical parts, at Ps I 272 to the four elements, at Ps I 279 to feelings, at Ps I 280 to the mind, at Ps I 286 to the hindrances, at Ps I 287 to the aggregates, at Ps I 289 to the sense-spheres, and at Ps I 300 to the awakening factors.
13.30	Vibh 116 points out that the third noble truth is unconditioned. Cf. also S V 442, ac￾cording to which a distinctive quality of a stream-enterer is full understanding of the four noble truths.
13.31	S V 437. Cf. also Kv 218; Vism 690–2; Bodhi 1984: p.126; and Cousins 1983: p.103. In fact, according to Sn 884 there is only one truth, which suggests that the scheme of four truths does not imply four separate truths. According to a discourse in the Chinese Saṃyukta Āgama, however, realization of the four noble truths has to take place sequentially, by first coming to fully know the truth of suffering, followed in turn by understanding each of the other noble truths (in Choong 2000: p.239).
14.1	M I 62. The prediction concerning the higher two stages of awakening occurs again forsatipaṭṭhāna at S V 181, and for mindfulness of breathing at S V 314, but also in a vari￾ety of other contexts, e.g. at S V 129–33; S V 236; A III 82; A III 143; A V 108; Sn 724–65; and It 39–41.
14.2	The freedom from sensual desire and aversion envisaged in the prediction echoes to some extent the “definition” part of the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta (M I 56), which relates the practice of satipaṭṭhāna to freedom from desires and discontent. Horner 1934: p.792, however, understands the expression “if there is a trace of clinging left” literally, as representing the arahant‘s awakening as opposed to his or her passing away; cf. also Masefield 1979: p.221.
14.3	The same occurs in a different context at D III 55, where the Buddha stated that within such a variable time period he could guide a disciple to realization. This could be a ref￾erence to satipaṭṭhāna, since the Buddha did not further specify in what he would in￾struct the disciple.
14.4	On this passage cf. Knight 1985: p.3; and Solé-Leris 1992: p.103.
14.5	According to T.W. Rhys Davids 1993: p.673, the number seven is invested with a “peculiar magic nimbus” in Pāli, which mitlitates against taking this prediction too lit￾erally. An example of such symbolic use of the number seven can be found at A IV 89, where the Buddha related a past life of his in which, as a fruit of seven years of loving kindness practice, he was not reborn in this world for seven aeons, for seven times he became a Mahā Brahmā, for many times seven he became a universal monarch, pos￾sessed of the seven treasures. Furthermore, in the above prediction at the end of the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta it is noticeable that, when counting down, “one year” is not fol￾lowed by “eleven months”, as should be expected, but by “seven months”, indicating that the sequence does not follow mathematical logic. According to Dumont 1962: p.73: “the number seven … indicates a totality” (in ancient India).
14.6	Minh Chau 1991: p.94; and Nhat Than 1990: p.166.
14.7	Ps I 302.
14.8	M II 96, however, with the specification that the Buddha himself was to train the prac￾titioner, a specification not stipulated in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta. This suggests that for realization within a single day the personal presence of the Buddha as the teacher is required. The five factors of striving mentioned in this discourse are confidence, physical health, honesty, energy, and wisdom regarding the arising and disappear￾ance of phenomena. (The last of these could represent the outcome of satipaṭṭhāna practice, especially of contemplating the nature of arising and passing away stipu￾lated in the “refrain”.)
14.9	On “sudden” and “gradual” cf. also Gethin 1992: pp.132 and 246; and Nanayakkara 1993b: p.581. Pensa 1977: p.335, relates this distinction to the difference between peak￾and plateau-experiences.
14.10	S III 154 and A IV 127.
14.11	e.g. at M I 479; M III 2; or A I 162. Cf. also Strenski 1980: pp.4 and 8.
14.12	Vin II 238; A IV 200; A IV 207; and Ud 54.
14.13	A I 254. Cf. also Dhp 239.
14.14	A I 240.
14.15	M I 104; M I 357; S III 154; and A IV 125. This simile has a slightly humorous undertone, since in a way it relates a meditator engaged in intensive practice to a hen on her eggs, both of whom spend much of their time sitting.
14.16	In fact Dhammavuddho 1999: p.10, suggests translating sotāpanna as “ear-entry”, be￾ing realized upon hearing a discourse. Similarly Masefield 1987: p.134, proposes that sota in the term sotāpanna refers to “hearing” rather than “stream”. However, on con￾sidering the discourses one finds that although listening to the Dhamma is mentioned at S V 347 as one of the factors of stream-entry, the same discourse clearly defines “stream” to refer to the noble eightfold path and a “stream-enterer” to be one who is in full possession of this noble eightfold path. In addition it could be pointed out that the Pāli term for receiving the Dhamma by hearing is sotānugata, not sotāpanna (cf. A II 185). The “stream” image comes up also at S V 38, where the noble eightfold path is compared to the Gaṅgā river, since it leads towards Nibbāna just as the Gaṅgā leads towards the sea.
14.17	Only the realization of arahantship was deemed of sufficient significance to merit be￾ing reported to the Buddha (aññā vyākaraṇa).
14.18	e.g. S III 167 relates realization of stream-entry to contemplation of the impermanent, unsatisfactory, and selfless nature of the five aggregates; A I 44 presents well-devel￾oped mindfulness of the body as capable of leading to stream-entry; and A III 442–3 propose the same potential for contemplating all formations as impermanent, unsat￾isfactory, and not-self. Cf. also D III 241 and A III 21, where listening to the Dhamma constitutes one out of five occasions for awakening, the others being teaching the Dhamma, reciting the Dhamma, reflecting on the Dhamma, and, last but not least, medi￾tation.
14.19	Cf. e.g. the Buddha’s admonition: “meditate, don’t be negligent!” (e.g. at M I 46; M I 118; M II 266; M III 302; S IV 133; S IV 359; S IV 361; S IV 368; S IV 373; S V 157; A III 87; A III 88; A IV 139; and A IV 392); or the frequent description of a meditator going off into se￾clusion for intensive practice and retreat (e.g. at D I 71; D I 207; D II 242; D III 49; M I 181; M I 269; M I 274; M I 346; M I 440; M II 162; M II 226; M III 3; M III 35; M III 115; M III 135; A II 210; A III 92; A III 100; A IV 436; and A V 207).
14.20	A IV 213.
14.21	S V 375.
14.22	According to S V 380, Sarakāni completed (paripûrakārī) the training at the time of his death, which indicates that Sarakāni attained stream-entry at that time. Since S V 379 has the same set of terms used in the definitions of the “Dhamma-follower” (dham￾mānusārī) and the “faith-follower” (saddhānusārī) at M I 479, it seems highly probable that he had been such a “follower” and was thus bound to realize stream-entry latest at death (cf. S III 225, which states that it is impossible for a Dhamma-follower or a faith-follower to pass away without having realized the fruit of stream-entry).
14.23	Ud 8; cf. page 229.
14.24	Bāhiya must have developed a high degree of mental purification by whatever type of practice he was following, since, according to the Udāna account, he (mistakenly) deemed himself already fully awakened. The sincerity of his aspiration becomes evi￾dent from the fact that, once a doubt about his presumed realization had arisen, he immediately undertook the journey across half the Indian subcontinent to meet the Buddha. His sense of urgency was so strong that he even went to search for the Buddha on his almsround, unable to await his return to the monastery. (The com￾mentary Ud-a 79 gives a rather incredible account of Bāhiya as a shipwrecked hypo￾crite, wearing bark in order to make an easy living, while his long journey across half of India was, according to Ud-a 86, a feat of supernormal power.)
14.25	Vin II 285.
14.26	Thī 80–1 and Th 408–9.
14.27	Dhp-a IV 63.
14.28	At A II 163 Sāriputta was asked whether realization was a matter of knowledge or of conduct, to both of which he replied in the negative, explaining that both were neces￾sary, yet not sufficient conditions for realization to take place. (On this passage cf. Jayatilleke 1967: p.456.) Similarly, according to Sn 839 purity is not simply the result of view, learning, knowledge, or conduct, nor can purity be gained in the absence of these.
14.29	Debes 1994: pp.204 and 208; and Kornfield 1979: p.53.
14.30	D II 157; S I 159; A I 236; A IV 3; A IV 4; and Th 906. Thī 116 has a slightly different formu￾lation, when Paṭācārā’s experience of Nibbāna actually coincided with the “nibbāna” of her lamp.
14.31	Cf. M III 245 and S V 319. Collins 1998: p.191, and T.W. Rhys Davids 1993: p.362, point out that Nibbāna refers to the extinction of a fire for lack of fuel, not through active blowing out.
14.32	Ṭhānissaro 1993: p.41. For parallels in the Upaniëads employing the imagery of extin￾guished fire cf. Schrader 1905: p.167.
14.33	D I 36. The Buddha’s definition of Nibbāna “here and now” can be found at A V 64.
14.34	M I 509. In the eyes of the Buddha this was clearly a mistaken view of Nibbāna.
14.35	e.g. at S IV 251; S IV 261; and S IV 371. S V 8 has the same definition for the “deathless”; while S I 39 and Sn 1109 define Nibbāna as the eradication of craving. This parallels a rather imaginative way of deriving the term Nibbāna found in the commentaries that takes Nibbāna to be composed of ni (absence) and vāna (as a metaphorical expression of craving), the entire compound then representing “absence of craving” (e.g. at Vism 293; also in Vajirañāṇa 1984: p.20).
14.36	This is maintained e.g. by van Zeyst 1961c: p.143.
14.37	M II 27.
14.38	e.g. Dhp 39; Dhp 267; Dhp 412; Sn 547; Sn 790; and Sn 900.
14.39	Ñāṇamoli 1995: p.1283 n.775, comments: “this passage shows the arahant, who main￾tains virtuous conduct but no longer identifies with his virtue”. Wijesekera 1994: p.35, explains that the practitioner should “master morality, but not allow morality to get the better of him”. Cf. also M I 319, where the Buddha pointed out that although he was possessed of a high level of virtue he did not identify with it.
14.40	According to Carter 1984: p.48, some degree of overlap exists between kusala and puñña in the context of the threefold volition, but a clear distinction between both terms can be drawn in regard to a person’s qualities.
14.41	In fact, according to D III 102, the realization of Nibbāna is the highest among whole￾some phenomena; cf. Premasiri 1976: p.68. Cf. also Collins 1998: p.154; and Nanayakkara 1999: p.258.
14.42	According to (e.g.) D III 133; D III 235; M I 523; and A IV 370 the ethical perfection of arahants is such that they are incapable of deliberately depriving a living being of life, of stealing, of engaging in any form of sexual intercourse, of lying, and of enjoying sensual pleasures by storing things up as householders do. Cf. also Lily de Silva 1996: p.7.
14.43	M I 318. Cf. also Premasiri 1990b: p.100.
14.44	D II 224; D III 135; A II 24; and It 122 point out that the Buddha acted as he spoke and spoke as he acted. This comes up in a different way at A IV 82, where the Buddha clar￾ified that for him there was no need to conceal any of his actions in order to avoid oth￾ers coming to know of them. The Buddha’s moral perfection is also mentioned at D III 217 and M II 115.
14.45	M I 464. (On correlating the activities mentioned in this passage with M I 11 or A III 390, the fact that “removing” is also mentioned appears strange and could be due to a textual corruption, as for the Buddha there would be no need to remove unwhole￾some thoughts, since they will not arise in the first place.)
14.46	M III 64 lists the following as impossibilities for a stream-enterer: killing one’s mother, killing one’s father, killing an arahant, wounding a Buddha, and causing a schism in the monastic community. The inability to commit such serious breaches of ethical conduct comes as one of the four limbs of stream-entry, a topic that occurs frequently in the discourses (e.g. at S V 343). In addition, according to M I 324 and Sn 232, stream-enterers are also unable to hide their wrongdoings.
14.47	e.g. at M I 486.
14.48	M I 487.
14.49	At M I 329 the Nibbānic realization (the “non-manifestative consciousness”) forms part of what almost amounts to a contest in which the Buddha proved that his realization was entirely beyond the ken of Brahmā, demonstrating metaphorically that it went beyond the hitherto known and valued types of realization. (On this passage cf. Jayatilleke 1970: p.115.)
14.50	M I 167 and S I 136. On the difficulty of describing Nibbāna with ordinary language cf. also Burns 1983: p.20; and Story 1984: p.42.
14.51	Ud 80. In this context “sphere” (āyatana) could be taken to refer to a “sphere” of experi￾ence, since on other occasions the same set of terms forms part of a description of a meditative experience, cf. A V 7; A V 319; A V 353; A V 355; A V 356; and A V 358. Mp V 2 relates these passages to the fruition-attainment of an arahant.
14.52	The anidassana viññāṇa at D I 223. On this passage cf. also Harvey 1989: p.88; Ñāṇananda 1986: p.66; and Ñāṇamoli 1980: p.178.
14.53	S II 103, where due to the complete absence of craving for any of the four nutriments, consciousness is “unstationed” (appatiṭṭhita), this in turn resulting in freedom from fu￾ture becoming.
14.54	Ud 80 and It 37. On this passage cf. Kalupahana 1994: p.92; and Norman 1991–3: p.220.
14.55	D III 275 and It 61. On this passage cf. Premasiri 1991: p.49.
14.56	Cf. e.g. M I 162, where one’s wife, children, and material possessions are defined as phenomena subject to birth, followed by classifying Nibbāna as not subject to birth. On possible implications of the term “birth” cf. also Buddhadāsa 1984: p.26; Govinda 1991: p.50; Harvey 1989: p.90; and Karunadasa 1994: p.11.
14.57	Tilakaratne 1993: p.74.
14.58	e.g. S IV 100 speaks of a cessation of all six sense-spheres, an expression which the commentary explains to refer to Nibbāna (Spk II 391). Another relevant reference could be the standard description of stream-entry (e.g. at S V 423), which speaks of the insight into the fact that whatever arises will also cease, an expression that may well hint at the subjective experience of Nibbāna, whence all conditionally arisen phenom￾ena cease. Similarly the declarations of realization at M III 265 and S IV 58 point to a cessation experience. Realization as a cessation experience is also reflected in the writ￾ings of modern meditation teachers and scholars, cf. e.g. Brown 1986b: p.205; Goenka 1994a: p.113, and 1999: p.34; Goleman 1977b: p.31; Griffith 1981: p.610; Kornfield 1993: p.291; Mahasi 1981: p.286; and Ñāṇārāma 1997: p.80. Cf. also footnote 30, page 257 above.
14.59	M I 38; this “escape” from the whole field of cognition is identified by the commentary with Nibbāna (Ps I 176). Similarly Thī 6 refers to Nibbāna as the stilling of all cognitions.
14.60	The question “what is the counterpart of Nibbāna?” (at M I 304) was a question which, according to the arahant nun Dhammadinnā, cannot be answered. The commentary Ps II 369 explains that Nibbāna has no counterpart.
14.61	This much can be deduced from a statement made by the Buddha (M II 229–33) that with the direct experience of Nibbāna all views and standpoints related to an experi￾ence of unity are left behind and transcended. Cf. also S II 77, where the Buddha re￾jected the view “all is one” as one of the extremes to be avoided. Furthermore, according to A IV 40 and A IV 401, in different celestial realms either unitary or diversi￾fied experiences prevail, so that a categorical statement like “all is one” would not accord with the early Buddhist description of cosmic reality. Cf. also Ling 1967: p.167.
14.62	The immaterial attainments are explicitly identified with “unity” at M III 220. In fact the whole series begins with the injunction not to pay attention to diversified cognitions as a basis for developing the sphere of infinite space (e.g. at A IV 306), which clearly indicates the unitary character of these experiences. At M III 106 the four immaterial attainments are again qualified as “unity” (ekatta), each of them forming part of a gradual “descent” into emptiness. The culmination of this gradual descent is reached with the destruction of the influxes (M III 108), at which point the qualifica￾tion “unity” is no longer used. This passage clearly demonstrates that full awakening goes beyond even the most refined experiences of oneness. This discourse also indi￾cates that there may be various types of “emptiness” experience, but that it is the com￾plete destruction of the influxes that determines whether (or not) an experience of emptiness does indeed constitute full awakening.
14.63	Cf. M I 165, where the Buddha remarked about Āíāra Kālāma and Uddaka Rāmaputta that their teaching was not conducive to complete disenchantment and therefore not sufficient to realize Nibbāna.
14.64	e.g. at M I 455–6, where the Buddha commented on each of the meditative absorp￾tions in turn: “this is not enough, abandon it, I say, surmount it!”
14.65	These were the arahants “freed by wisdom”, who according to their canonical defini￾tion (e.g. at M I 477) had destroyed the influxes without having experienced the im￾material attainments.
14.66	Vin III 2; A IV 174; and A IV 183. Cf. also Vin I 234; Vin III 3; M I 140; and A V 190; where the Buddha is called a “nihilist”.
14.67	Bodhi 1996: p.171; Ñāṇapoṇika 1986a: p.25; and Sobti 1985: p.134.
14.68	S IV 368–73 gives a long list of such epithets. A similar but shorter list occurs at A IV 453.
14.69	Nibbāna as the highest happiness occurs e.g. at M I 508; Dhp 203; Dhp 204; and Thī 476. These expressions refer to the arahant‘s experience of the happiness of liberation, cf. e.g. M II 104; S I 196; Ud 1; Ud 10; and Ud 32. The superiority of this happiness over all other types of happiness is stated at Ud 11. However, it should be pointed out that Nibbāna itself is not a felt type of happiness, since with Nibbāna all feelings cease. This is documented at A IV 414, where Sāriputta stated that Nibbāna is happiness. When questioned how there could possibly be happiness in the absence of any feeling, he explained that for him it was precisely the absence of feeling that constituted happi￾ness. Similarly at M I 400 the Buddha explained that he considered even the cessation of feelings and cognitions to constitute happiness, since he did not limit the concept of “happiness” to happy feelings only. Johansson 1969: p.25, explains that Nibbāna is “’a source of happiness’ and not ‘a state of happiness’”.
14.70	M II 232.
14.71	Since it is one of the forms of craving included in the second noble truth (cf. e.g. S V 421).
14.72	M III 246.
14.73	At S IV 383, the destiny of an arahant after death posed a dilemma for the monk Anurādha, which he attempted to resolve by stating that it could be described in a way other than the four standard propositions used in ancient India in such discus￾sions. After dismissing this (according to Indian logic impossible) fifth alternative, the Buddha led Anurādha to the conclusion that even while still alive an arahant cannot be identified with any of the five aggregates, or with anything outside of them. The same reasoning can be found at S III 112, where Sāriputta rebuked the monk Yamaka for presuming that arahants are annihilated at death.
14.74	Sn 1074 compares the arahant to a flame which, once gone out, can no longer be reck￾oned in terms of “flame”. Sn 1076 explains that there is no measuring of one who has thus gone out, since with all phenomena removed, all pathways of language are also removed. The only acceptable declaration to be made about arahants at death (cf. D II 109 and D III 135) is that they “enter the Nibbāna element without remainder”. This declaration is further explained at It 38 to imply that in the case of an arahant passing away, all that is felt and experienced, because it is no longer delighted in, will simply become cool.
14.75	Dhp 93 and Th 92.
15.1	M I 82. The commentary on this passage, Ps II 52, has each of the four questioners specialize in one of the four satipaṭṭhānas.
15.2	M III 221 (cf. also page 30).
15.3	S V 144. That different levels of disciples should practise satipaṭṭhāna comes up again at S V 299. (Woodward 1979: vol.V p.265, translates this passage as if the practice of satipaṭṭhāna “should be abandoned”. This rendering is not convincing, since in the present context the Pāli term vihātabba is better translated as a future passive form of viharati, not of vijahati.)
15.4	The need for a basis in ethical conduct before embarking on satipaṭṭhāna is stated e.g. at S V 143; S V 165; S V 187; and S V 188. Cf. also S V 171, according to which the very purpose of ethical conduct is to lead up to the practice of satipaṭṭhāna. S V 143 and 165 add “straight view” (diṭṭhi ca ujukā) to the necessary conditions for satipaṭṭhāna.
15.5	A IV 457.
15.6	S III 51 and S IV 142 present the direct experience of the impermanent nature of the ag￾gregates or the sense-spheres as “right view”, a form of right view that is clearly an outcome of insight meditation.
15.7	A III 450.
15.8	It should be pointed out, however, that there is a clear qualitative difference between satipaṭṭhāna practised by a beginner and by an arahant. S V 144 describes this qualita￾tive progression, which leads from the initial insight of the beginner, via the penetra￾tive comprehension of the advanced practitioner, to the full freedom from any attachment during the contemplation undertaken by an arahant. Even for the begin￾ner’s initial insight, this discourse stipulates that satipaṭṭhāna is to be undertaken with a calm and concentrated mind for true insight to arise, a requirement not easily met by those who have just started to practise.
15.9	S III 168 explains that although arahants have nothing more to do, they continue to contemplate the five aggregates as impermanent, unsatisfactory, and not-self, be￾cause for them this is a pleasant form of abiding here and now and a source of mind￾fulness and clear knowledge. At S I 48 the Buddha explained again that arahants, although meditating, have nothing more to do since they have “gone beyond”. Cf. also Ray 1994: p.87.
15.10	S V 175 defines an arahant as one who has perfected the cultivation of satipaṭṭhāna. According to S V 302, arahants often dwell established in satipaṭṭhāna. The arahant‘s de￾light in seclusion is documented at D III 283; A IV 224; and A V 175. The arahant‘s profi￾ciency in satipaṭṭhāna comes up again at A IV 224 and at A V 175. Katz 1989: p.67, concludes: “satipaṭṭhāna … arahants enjoy this practice, which would mean … that it is a natural expression of their attainment”.
15.11	According to D II 223, Nibbāna and the path coalesce, just as the Gaṅgā and the Yamunā rivers coalesce. Malalasekera 1995: vol.I p.734, explains that “the junction of the Gaṅgā and the Yamunā … is used as a simile for perfect union”.
15.12	M I 56: “mindfulness … is established in him to the extent necessary for … continuous mindfulness”.
15.13	e.g. S V 326 reports the Buddha and some arahants engaged in the practice of mindful￾ness of breathing. From among the arahant disciples, Anuruddha was known for his frequent practice of satipaṭṭhāna (cf. S V 294–306). Sn 157 stresses again that the Buddha did not neglect meditation. Cf. also M III 13, where the Buddha is character￾ized as one who practised meditation and followed the conduct of a meditator.
15.14	e.g. at D I 179; D III 37; M I 514; M II 2; M II 23; M II 30; A V 185; and A V 190; the Buddha and his followers are characterized as being “in favour of silence, practising silence, praising silence”. Cf. also S III 15 and S IV 80, where the Buddha emphatically exhorted his disciples to make an effort at living in seclusion. According to A III 422, seclusion is in fact a necessary requirement for gaining real control over the mind. Cf. also It 39 and Sn 822, where the Buddha spoke again in praise of seclusion. At Vin I 92 the Buddha even exempted junior monks from the need to live in dependence on a teacher if they were meditating in seclusion. Living in community almost appears to be a second-rate alternative, since at S I 154 such community life is recommended to those monks who are unable to find delight in seclusion (cf. also Ray 1994: p.96). The importance of seclusion in the historically early stages of the Buddhist monastic community is also noted by Panabokke 1993: p.14. To live in seclusion, however, requires some degree of meditative proficiency, as the Buddha pointed out at M I 17 and A V 202. If such meditative proficiency was lacking, the Buddha would advise monks against going off into seclusion (cf. the cases of Upāli at A V 202 and Meghiya at Ud 34).
15.15	D I 50.
15.16	At M I 457 a newly-ordained group of monks was dismissed by the Buddha for being too noisy. The same happened again at Ud 25. At A III 31 (= A III 342 and A IV 341), the Buddha was disinclined to accept food brought by a group of householders because they were creating a lot of noise. On the other hand, however, merely to observe silence for its own sake was criticized by the Buddha. At Vin I 157 he rebuked a group of monks who had spent a rainy season together in complete silence, apparently in order to avoid communal discord. This case needs to be considered in the light of M I 207, where the silent cohabitation of a group of monks is described in the same terms, but met with the Buddha’s approval. Here the decisive difference was that every fifth day this group of monks would interrupt their silence and discuss the Dhamma, i.e. in this case silence was not observed to avoid dissension, but was employed as a means to create a suitable meditative atmosphere and at the same time wisely balanced with regular discussions about the Dhamma. In fact these two activities, either discussing the Dhamma or observing silence, were often recommended by the Buddha as the two appropriate ways of spending time with others (e.g. at M I 161).
15.17	Ud 41. A similar action was undertaken at A V 133 by a group of senior monks who departed without even taking their leave of the Buddha in order to avoid the noise created by some visitors, an action which the Buddha, on being told later, approved.
15.18	Vin II 259 and A IV 280.
15.19	Vin III 68; S V 12; and S V 320 report the Buddha spending two weeks in complete seclusion on a silent retreat, while Vin III 229; S V 13; and S V 325 report the same for a three-month period.
15.20	e.g. at D I 151. According to D II 270, even Sakka, king of gods, had once to depart with￾out being able to meet the Buddha, because he was not allowed to disturb the Buddha’s meditation.
15.21	M III 111.
15.22	D I 175 and D III 38.
15.23	At D III 54 the Buddha pointed out that all Awakened Ones of past times had similarly been dedicated to seclusion and silence. M I 23 and A I 60 explain his reasons for living in seclusion to be a pleasant abiding here and now and out of compassion for future generations. Cf. also Mil 138.
15.24	D II 83; D III 101; and S V 161. At S I 103 the Buddha explicitly stated that his awakening took place based on sati.
15.25	A V 195. This statement appears to be of such crucial importance that in the satipaṭṭhāna version preserved in the Chinese Madhyama Āgama it has become part of the introductory part of the discourse itself, cf. Nhat Hanh 1990: p.151.
15.26	In fact, according to A V 153, mindfulness is essential for growth in the Dhamma. The usefulness of satipaṭṭhāna is further corroborated by the substantial list of its possible benefits at A IV 457–60.
15.27	S V 179.
15.28	S V 155.
15.29	e.g. according to M I 340 the lay disciple Pessa engaged from time to time in sati￾paṭṭhāna. Pessa’s practice is qualified in this discourse with the expression “well estab￾lished” (supatiṭṭhita), which clearly indicates that it must have been of a rather advanced level. S V 177 and S V 178 report the laymen Sirivaḍḍha and Mānadinna both engaged in the practice of satipaṭṭhāna. Both were then declared by the Buddha to have achieved non-returning.
15.30	Ps I 241 explains that in the present context “monk” includes whoever engages in the practice.
15.31	D II 77; D II 79; S V 172; S V 173; and S V 174.
15.32	S V 301. It is revealing to contrast this statement with A III 396, according to which even a fourth jhāna attainer is still liable to disrobing and returning to a worldly life￾style.
15.33	D II 100; D III 58; D III 77; S V 154; S V 163; and S V 164 speak of those engaging in satipaṭṭhāna as becoming like an island and thereby a refuge to themselves. Com￾menting on this statement, Sv II 549 emphasizes that it is the practice of satipaṭṭhānas that will lead to the highest.
15.34	S V 189. It is a little surprising that this discourse has not made its way into the Chinese Āgamas (cf. Akanuma 1990: 247).
15.35	S V 169. On this passage cf. also Ñāṇapoṇika 1990: p.3; Ñāṇavīra 1987: p.211; Piyadassi 1972: p.475; and Ṭhānissaro 1996: p.81.
15.36	M I 45. Likewise Dhp 158 recommends being well established oneself before teaching others. Cf. also A II 95–9, where the Buddha distinguished between four possibilities of practice: for one’s own benefit only, or for others’ benefit only, or for the benefit of neither, or for the benefit of both. His perhaps surprising position was that to practise for one’s own benefit only is superior to practising for the benefit of others only (cf. also Dhp 166). The underlying rationale is that unless one is established oneself in overcoming unwholesomeness (A II 96) or in ethical restraint (A II 99), one will be un￾able to benefit others. Cf. also Premasiri 1990c: p.160, who points out the need for a basis of internal peace before proceeding to serve others.
15.37	Sn 320.
15.38	Nibbāna is referred to as the “perfection of wisdom” at M III 245 and Th 1015; as the highest happiness at Dhp 204; and as unsurpassable freedom at M I 235.
