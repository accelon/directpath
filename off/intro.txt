Satipatthana: The Direct Path to Realization is a gem. Ven. Analayo has done a superb job of elucidating this core teaching of the Buddha. His clarity of style, nuanced observations, and depth of analysis opens many new doors of understanding. I learned a lot from this wonderful book and highly recommend it to both experienced meditators and those just beginning to explore the path.
Joseph Goldstein, author of ‘One Dharma: The Emerging Western Buddhism’
‘This book helps to fill what has long been a glaring gap in the scholarship on Early Buddhism, offering us a detailed textual study of the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, the founda￾tional Buddhist discourse on meditation practice. With painstaking thoroughness, Ven. Anālayo marshals the suttas of the Pāli canon, works of modern scholarship, and the teachings of present-day meditation masters to make the rich implications of this text, so concise in the original, clear to contemporary students of the Dharma. Unlike more popular books on the subject, he is not out to establish the exclusive validity of one particular system of meditation as against others; his aim, rather, is to explore the sutta as a wide-ranging and multi-faceted source of guidance which allows for alter￾native interpretations and approaches to practice. His analysis combines the detached objectivity of the academic scholar with the engaged concern of the practi￾tioner for whom meditation is a way of life rather than just a subject of study. The book should prove to be of value both to scholars of Early Buddhism and to serious meditators alike. Ideally, it will encourage in both types of reader the same whole￾some synthesis of scholarship and practice that underlies the author’s own treatment of his subject.’
Bhikkhu Bodhi, scholar and translator
‘This book explains in detail the full meaning of the entire body of teaching given in this discourse. I believe this commentary by Anālayo on this root text surpasses all previous commentaries in the Theravāda tradition over the past 2,000 years. Anālayo has written an indispensable guide to enable students of the Buddha’s teachings to understand this celebrated talk. His book reads like a practice manual for meditators in daily life.
‘It is surely destined to become the classic commentary on the Satipaṭṭhāna. It will also inspire readers interested in the Buddhist tradition to develop such down-to￾earth practices for their own realization.’
Christopher Titmuss, writer and co-founder of Gaia House meditation centre
‘Ven. Anālayo has produced a very thorough and comprehensive study of the Buddha’s discourse on satipaṭṭhāna. It is to be recommended not only for the way in which it examines these instructions in meditation in the context of the early dis￾courses and in relation to the traditional interpretations of the Pāli commentaries, but also for the way in which it encompasses the observations and interpretations of both modern scholars of Buddhism and teachers of meditation. For anyone interested in the theory and practice of satipaṭṭhāna meditation this is a most valuable guide.’
Rupert Gethin, Senior Lecturer on Indian Religions at the University of Bristol

INTRODUCTION The present work, which is the combined outcome of my Ph.D.
research at the University of Peradeniya in Sri Lanka and my own practical experience as a meditating monk, attempts a detailed ex￾ploration of the significance and the practice of mindfulness medita￾tion according to its exposition in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, and placed within its early Buddhist canonical and philosophical context.
Mindfulness and the proper way of putting it into practice are cer￾tainly topics of central relevance for anyone keen to tread the Buddha’s path to liberation. Yet for a proper understanding and im￾plementation of mindfulness meditation the original instructions by the Buddha on satipaṭṭhāna need to be taken into consideration. In view of this, my inquiry is in particular concerned with the dis￾courses recorded in the four main Nikāyas and the historically early parts of the fifth Nikāya as centrally important source material.
Satipaṭṭhāna is a matter of practice. In order to ensure that my ex￾ploration has practical relevance, I have consulted a selection of modern meditation manuals and related publications. The nature of this selection has been mainly a matter of availability, yet I hope to have included a fairly representative number of meditation teach￾ers. Apart from these, I have also relied on various academic mono￾graphs and articles on early Buddhism in order to illustrate the philosophical framework and historical context within which the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta is to be understood. These provide the back￾ground information for understanding particular passages or expressions in the discourse.

To help maintain text flow and readability, I have kept the main body of the text as free as possible from direct quotations and tan￾gential observations. Instead, I have made extensive use of foot￾notes, which provide references of interest and discussions of additional information. The general reader may prefer to focus on the body of the text during a first reading, and only turn to the infor￾mation in the footnotes during a second reading.
My exposition follows the sequence of the passages in the dis￾course as closely as possible. At the same time, however, my treat￾ment is not restricted to simple comments, but allows for minor digressions in order to explore relevant points and to provide a background for better understanding the section under discussion.
The first chapter deals with general aspects and terminology in re￾lation to satipaṭṭhāna. The next three chapters are concerned with the second paragraph of the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, the “definition”, es￾pecially with the implications of sati and the role of concentration.
In the fifth chapter I turn to a set of general instructions repeated throughout the discourse after each meditation exercise, the “re￾frain”. With the sixth chapter I begin to examine the actual exercises of the “direct path” of mindfulness meditation, concerned with con￾templating the body, feelings, mind, and dhammas. At the end of this examination of the individual meditation practices I turn to the final paragraph of the discourse and to the implications of Nibbāna. By way of conclusion, I try to highlight some key aspects of satipaṭṭhāna and to evaluate its importance.
In general, my purpose in the present inquiry is less to prove and establish a particular point of view than to provide suggestions and reflections in the hope of opening up new perspectives in regard to satipaṭṭhāna, and in the hope of inspiring the reader to engage in its actual practice.
