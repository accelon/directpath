general aspect	^ya(GENERAL ASPECTS OF THE DIRECT PATH)
To begin, I will survey the underlying structure of the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta and consider some general aspects of the four satipaṭṭhānas.
 I will then examine the expressions “direct path” and “satipaṭṭhāna”.
overview	^ya1(OVERVIEW OF THE SATIPAṬṬHĀNA SUTTA)
Satipaṭṭhāna as the “direct path” to Nibbāna has received a detailed treatment in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta of the Majjhima Nikāya.^i1
 Precisely the same discourse recurs as the Mahāsatipaṭṭhāna Sutta of the Dīgha Nikāya, the only difference being that this version offers a more extensive treatment of the four noble truths, the last of the satipaṭṭhāna contemplations.^i2
 The topic of satipaṭṭhāna has moreover inspired several shorter discourses in the Saṃyutta Nikāya and the Aṅguttara Nikāya. ^i3
 Apart from the Pāli sources, expositions on satipaṭṭhāna are also preserved in Chinese and Sanskrit, with intriguing occasional variations from the Pāli presentations.^i4^pg29
	Most of the discourses in the Saṃyutta Nikāya and Aṅguttara Nikāya mention only the bare outline of the four satipaṭṭhānas, without going into the details of their possible applications.
 This functional division into four satipaṭṭhānas seems to be a direct outcome of the Buddha’s awakening,^i5 a central aspect of his rediscovery of an ancient path of practice.^i6
 But the detailed instructions found in the Mahāsatipaṭṭhāna Sutta and the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta apparently belong to a later period, when the Buddha’s teaching had spread from the Ganges valley to the distant Kammāsadhamma in the Kuru country, where both discourses were spoken.^i7^pg30
	In Fig. 1.1 (below) I have attempted to offer an overview of the structure underlying the detailed exposition of satipaṭṭhāna given in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, with each of the sections of the discourse represented by a box and arranged from bottom to top.
	The starting and concluding section of the discourse is a passage which states that satipaṭṭhāna constitutes the direct path to Nibbāna.
 The next section of the discourse offers a short definition of the most essential aspects of this direct path.
 This “definition” mentions four satipaṭṭhānas for contemplation: body, feelings, mind, and dhammas.^i8
 The “definition” also specifies the mental qualities that are instrumental for satipaṭṭhāna: one should be diligent (ātāpī), clearly ^pg31 knowing (sampajāna), mindful (sati), and free from desires and discontent (vineyya abhijjhādomanassa).
	After this “definition”, the discourse describes the foursatipaṭṭhānas of body, feelings, mind, and dhammas in detail.
 The range of the first satipaṭṭhāna, contemplation of the body, proceeds from mindfulness of breathing, postures, and activities, via analyses of the body into its anatomical parts and elements, to contemplating a corpse in decay.
 The next two satipaṭṭhānas are concerned with contemplating feelings and mind.
 The fourth satipaṭṭhāna lists five types of dhammas for contemplation: the mental hindrances, the aggregates, the sense-spheres, the awakening factors, and the four noble truths.
 After the actual meditation practices, the discourse returns to the direct path statement via a prediction about the time within which realization can be expected.
Throughout the discourse, a particular formula follows each individual meditation practice.
 This satipaṭṭhāna “refrain” completes each instruction by repeatedly emphasizing the important aspects of the practice.^i9
 According to this “refrain”, satipaṭṭhāna contemplation covers internal and external phenomena, and is concerned with their arising and passing away.
 The “refrain” also points out that mindfulness should be established merely for the sake of developing bare knowledge and for achieving continuity of awareness.
 According to the same “refrain”, proper satipaṭṭhāna contemplation takes place free from any dependence or clinging.
The entire discourse is framed by an introduction, which conveys the occasion of its delivery, and a conclusion, which reports the delighted reaction of the monks after the Buddha’s exposition.^i10
By placing the “definition” and the “refrain” at the centre of the above figure, I intend to highlight their central role in the discourse.
 As the figure shows, the discourse weaves a recurring pattern that systematically alternates between specific meditation instructions ^pg32 and the “refrain”.
 Each time, the task of the “refrain” is to direct attention to those aspects of satipaṭṭhāna that are essential for proper practice.
 The same pattern also applies to the start of the discourse, where a general introduction to the topic of satipaṭṭhāna through the “direct path” statement is followed by the “definition”, which has the role of pointing out its essential characteristics.
 In this way, both the “definition” and the “refrain” indicate what is essential.
 Thus, for a proper understanding and implementation of satipaṭṭhāna, the information contained in the “definition” and the “refrain” is of particular importance.
survey	^ya2(A SURVEY OF THE FOUR SATIPAṬṬHĀNAS)
On closer inspection, the sequence of the contemplations listed in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta reveals a progressive pattern (cf. Fig. 1.2 below).
 Contemplation of the body progresses from the rudimentary experience of bodily postures and activities to contemplating the body’s anatomy.
 The increased sensitivity developed in this way forms the basis for contemplation of feelings, a shift of awareness from the immediately accessible physical aspects of experience to feelings as more refined and subtle objects of awareness.

^fig1.2(Progression of the satipaṭṭhāna contemplations)^pg33
	Contemplation of feeling divides feelings not only according to their affective quality into pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral types, but also distinguishes these according to their worldly or unworldly nature.
 The latter part of contemplation of feelings thus introduces an ethical distinction of feelings, which serves as a stepping-stone for directing awareness to the ethical distinction between wholesome and unwholesome states of mind, mentioned at the start of the next satipaṭṭhāna, contemplation of the mind.
	Contemplation of the mind proceeds from the presence or absence of four unwholesome states of mind (lust, anger, delusion, and distraction), to contemplating the presence or absence of four higher states of mind.
 The concern with higher states of mind in the latter part of the contemplation of the mind naturally lends itself to a detailed investigation of those factors which particularly obstruct deeper levels of concentration.
 These are the hindrances, the first object of contemplation of dhammas.
	After covering the hindrances to meditation practice, contemplation of dhammas progresses to two analyses of subjective experience:
 the five aggregates and the six sense-spheres.
 These analyses are followed by the awakening factors, the next contemplation of dhammas.
 The culmination of satipaṭṭhāna practice is reached with the contemplation of the four noble truths, full understanding of which coincides with realization.
	Considered in this way, the sequence of the satipaṭṭhāna contemplations leads progressively from grosser to more subtle levels.^i11
 This linear progression is not without practical relevance, since the body contemplations recommend themselves as a foundational exercise for building up a basis of sati,
 while the final contemplation of the four noble truths covers the experience of Nibbāna (the third noble truth concerning the cessation of dukkha) and thus corresponds to the culmination of any successful implementation of satipaṭṭhāna.
	At the same time, however, this progressive pattern does not^pg34 prescribe the only possible way of practising satipaṭṭhāna.
 To take the progression of the meditation exercises in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta as indicating a necessary sequence would severely limit the range of one’s practice, since only those experiences or phenomena that fit into this preconceived pattern would be proper objects of awareness.
 Yet a central characteristic of satipaṭṭhāna is awareness of phenomena as they are, and as they occur.
 Although such awareness will naturally proceed from the gross to the subtle, in actual practice it will quite probably vary from the sequence depicted in the discourse.
	A flexible and comprehensive development of satipaṭṭhāna should encompass all aspects of experience, in whatever sequence they occur.
 All satipaṭṭhānas can be of continual relevance throughout one’s progress along the path.
 The practice of contemplating the body, for example, is not something to be left behind and discarded at some more advanced point in one’s progress.
 Much rather, it continues to be a relevant practice even for an arahant.^i12
 Understood in this way, the meditation exercises listed in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta can be seen as mutually supportive.
 The sequence in which they are practised may be altered in order to meet the needs of each individual meditator.
	Not only do the four satipaṭṭhānas support each other, but they could even be integrated within a single meditation practice.
 This is documented in the Ānāpānasati Sutta, which describes how mindfulness of breathing can be developed in such a way that it encompasses all four satipaṭṭhānas.^i13 This exposition demonstrates the possibility of comprehensively combining all four satipaṭṭhānas within the practice of a single meditation.
relevance	^ya3(THE RELEVANCE OF EACH SATIPAṬṬHĀNA FOR REALIZATION)
According to the Ānāpānasati Sutta, it is possible to develop a variety of different aspects ofsatipaṭṭhāna contemplation with a single meditation object and in due course cover all four satipaṭṭhānas.
 This raises the question how far a single satipaṭṭhāna, or even a single meditation exercise, can be taken as a complete practice in its own right.^pg35
	Several discourses relate the practice of a single satipaṭṭhāna directly to realization.^i14
 Similarly, the commentaries assign to each single satipaṭṭhāna meditation the capacity to lead to full awakening.^i15
 This may well be why a high percentage of present-day meditation teachers focus on the use of a single meditation technique, on the ground that a single-minded and thorough perfection of one meditation technique can cover all aspects of satipaṭṭhāna, and thus be sufficient to gain realization.^i16
	Indeed, the development of awareness with any particular meditation technique will automatically result in a marked increase in one’s general level of awareness, thereby enhancing one’s capacity to be mindful in regard to situations that do not form part of one’s primary object of meditation.
 In this way, even those aspects of satipaṭṭhāna that have not deliberately been made the object of contemplation to some extent still receive mindful attention as a by-product of the primary practice.
 Yet the exposition in the Ānāpānasati Sutta does not necessarily imply that by being aware of the breath one automatically covers all aspects of satipaṭṭhāna.
 What the Buddha demonstrated here was how a thorough development of sati can lead from the breath to a broad range of objects, encompassing different aspects of subjective reality.
 Clearly, such a broad range of aspects was the outcome of a deliberate development, otherwise the Buddha would not have needed to deliver a whole discourse on how to achieve this.
	In fact, several meditation teachers and scholars place a strong emphasis on covering all four satipaṭṭhānas in one’s practice.^i17
 According to them, although one particular meditation practice can ^pg36 serve as the primary object of attention, the other aspects of satipaṭṭhāna should be deliberately contemplated too, even if only in a secondary manner.
 This approach can claim some support from the concluding part of the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, the “prediction” of realization.
 This passage stipulates the development of all four satipaṭṭhānas for contemplation to lead to the realization of the higher two stages of awakening: non-returning and arahantship.^i18
 The fact that all four satipaṭṭhānas are mentioned suggests that it is the comprehensive practice of all four which is particularly capable of leading to high levels of realization.
 The same is also indicated by a statement in the Satipaṭṭhāna Saṃyutta, which relates the realization of arahantship to “complete” practice of the four satipaṭṭhānas, while partial practice corresponds to lesser levels of realization.^i19
	In a passage in the Ānāpāna Saṃyutta, the Buddha compared the four satipaṭṭhānas to chariots coming from four directions, each driving through and thereby scattering a heap of dust lying at the centre of a crossroads.^i20
 This simile suggests that each satipaṭṭhāna is in itself capable of overcoming unwholesome states, just as any of the chariots is able to scatter the heap of dust.
 At the same time this simile also illustrates the cooperative effect of all four satipaṭṭhānas, since, with chariots coming from all directions, the heap of dust will be scattered even more.
	Thus any single meditation practice from the satipaṭṭhāna scheme is capable of leading to deep insight, especially if developed according to the key instructions given in the “definition” and “refrain” of the discourse.
 Nevertheless, an attempt to cover all four satipaṭṭhānas in one’s practice does more justice to the distinct character of the various meditations described in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta and thereby ensures speedy progress and a balanced and comprehensive development.^i21^pg37
character	^ya4(THE CHARACTER OF EACH SATIPAṬṬHĀNA)
The need for such comprehensive development is related to the fact that each satipaṭṭhāna has a different character and can thereby serve a slightly different purpose.
 This is documented in the Nettippakaraṇa and the commentaries, which illustrate the particular character of each satipaṭṭhāna with a set of correlations (cf.  Fig. 1.3 below).
	According to the commentaries, each of the four satipaṭṭhānas corresponds to a particular aggregate: the aggregates of material form (rūpa), feeling (vedanā), and consciousness (viññāṇa) match the first three satipaṭṭhānas, while the aggregates of cognition (saññā) and volitions (saṅkhārā) correspond to the contemplation of dhammas.^i22
	On closer inspection, this correlation appears a little forced, since the third satipaṭṭhāna, contemplation of the mind, corresponds to all mental aggregates and not only to consciousness.
 Moreover, the fourth satipaṭṭhāna, contemplation of dhammas, includes the entire set of the five aggregates as one of its meditations, and thus has a wider range than just the two aggregates of cognition (saññā) and volition (saṅkhārā).
	Nevertheless, what the commentaries might intend to indicate is that all aspects of one’s subjective experience are to be investigated with the aid of the four satipaṭṭhānas.
 Understood in this way, the division into four satipaṭṭhānas represents an analytical approach similar to a division of subjective experience into the five aggregates.
 Both attempt to dissolve the illusion of the observer’s substantiality.^i23
 By turning awareness to different facets of one’s subjective experience, these aspects will be experienced simply as objects, and the notion of compactness, the sense of a solid “I”, will begin to disintegrate.
 In this way, the more subjective experience can be seen “objectively”, the more the “I”-dentification diminishes.^i24
 This correlates well with the Buddha’s instruction to investigate thoroughly each aggregate to the point where no more “I” can be found.^i25
	In addition to the aggregate correlation, the commentaries recommend each of the four satipaṭṭhānas for a specific type of character or ^pg38 inclination.
 According to them, body and feeling contemplation should be the main field of practice for those who tend towards craving, while meditators given to intellectual speculation should place more emphasis on contemplating mind or dhammas. ^i26 Understood in this way, practice of the first two satipaṭṭhānas suits those with a more affective inclination, while the last two are recommended for those of a more cognitive orientation.
 In both cases, those whose character is to think and react quickly can profitably centre their practice on the relatively subtler contemplations of feelings or dhammas, while those whose mental faculties are more circumspect and measured will have better results if they base their practice on the grosser objects of body or mind.
 Although these recommendations are expressed in terms of character type, they could also be applied to one’s momentary disposition: one could choose that satipaṭṭhāna that best corresponds to one’s state of mind, so that when one feels sluggish and desirous, for example, contemplation of the body would be the appropriate practice to be undertaken.

^fig1.3(Correlations for the four satipaṭṭhānas)
	The Nettippakaraṇa and the Visuddhimagga also set the four satipaṭṭhānas in opposition to the four distortions (vipallāsas), which are to “mis-take” what is unattractive, unsatisfactory, impermanent, and not-self, for being attractive, satisfactory, permanent, and a self.^i27^pg39
 According to them, contemplation of the body has the potential to reveal in particular the absence of bodily beauty; observation of the true nature of feelings can counter one’s incessant search for fleeting pleasures;
 awareness of the ceaseless succession of states of mind can disclose the impermanent nature of all subjective experience;
 and contemplation of dhammas can reveal that the notion of a substantial and permanent self is nothing but an illusion.
 This presentation brings to light the main theme that underlies each of the four satipaṭṭhānas and indicates which of them is particularly appropriate for dispelling the illusion of beauty, happiness, permanence, or self.^i28
 Although the corresponding insights are certainly not restricted to one satipaṭṭhāna alone, nevertheless this particular correlation indicates which satipaṭṭhāna is particularly suitable in order to correct a specific distortion (vipallāsa).
 This correlation, too, may be fruitfully applied in accordance with one’s general character disposition, or else can be used in order to counteract the momentary manifestation of any particular distortion.
	In the end, however, all four satipaṭṭhānas partake of the same essence.
 Each of them leads to realization, like different gateways leading to the same city.^i29
 As the commentaries point out, the fourfold division is only functional and can be compared to a weaver splitting a piece of bamboo into four parts to weave a basket.^i30
	So much for a preliminary survey of the four satipaṭṭhānas.
 By way of providing some background to the title I have chosen for this work, I will now turn to the two key expressions “direct path” and “satipaṭṭhāna”.^pg40
expression	^ya5(THE EXPRESSION “DIRECT PATH”)
The first section of the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta proper introduces the four satipaṭṭhānas as the “direct path” to realization.
 The passage reads:
	^sutta Monks, this is the direct path for the purification of beings, for the surmounting of sorrow and lamentation, for the disappearance of dukkha and discontent, for acquiring the true method, for the realization of Nibbāna, namely, the four satipaṭṭhānas.^i31
	The qualification of being a “direct path” occurs in the discourses almost exclusively as an attribute of satipaṭṭhāna, thus it conveys a considerable degree of emphasis.^i32
 Such emphasis is indeed warranted, since practice of the “direct path” of satipaṭṭhāna is an indispensable requirement for liberation.^i33
 As a set of verses in the Satipaṭṭhāna Saṃyutta point out, satipaṭṭhāna is the “direct path” for crossing the flood in past, present, and future times.^i34
	“Direct path” is a translation of the Pāli expression ekāyano maggo, made up of the parts eka, “one”, ayana, “going”, and magga, “path”.
The commentarial tradition has preserved five alternative explanations for understanding this particular expression.
 According to them, a path qualified as ekāyano could be understood as a “direct” ath in the sense of leading straight to the goal; as a path to be travelled by oneself “alone”; as a path taught by the “One” (the Buddha); as a path that is found “only” in Buddhism; or as a path which leads to “one” goal, namely to Nibbāna.^i35
 My rendering of ekāyano as “direct path” follows the first of these explanations.^i36
 A more ^pg41 commonly used translation of ekāyano is “the only path”, corresponding to the fourth of the five explanations found in the commentaries.
	In order to assess the meaning of a particular Pāli term, its different occurrences in the discourses need to be taken into account.
 In the present case, in addition to occurring in several discourses in relation to satipaṭṭhāna, ekāyano also comes up once in a different context.
 This is in a simile in the Mahāsīhanāda Sutta, which describes a man walking along a path leading to a pit, such that one can anticipate him falling into the pit.^i37
 This path is qualified as ekāyano.
 In this context ekāyano seems to express straightness of direction rather than exclusion.
 To say that this path leads “directly” to the pit would be more fitting than saying that it is “the only” path leading to the pit.
	Of related interest is also the Tevijja Sutta, which reports two Brahmin students arguing about whose teacher taught the only correct path to union with Brahmā.
 Although in this context an exclusive expression like “the only path” might be expected, the qualification ekāyano is conspicuously absent.^i38
 The same absence recurs in a verse from the Dhammapada, which presents the noble eightfold path as “the only path”.^i39
 These two instances suggest that the discourses did not avail themselves of the qualification ekāyano in order to convey exclusiveness.
	Thus ekāyano, conveying a sense of directness rather than exclusiveness, draws attention to satipaṭṭhāna as the aspect of the noble eightfold path most “directly” responsible for uncovering a vision of things as they truly are.
 That is, satipaṭṭhāna is the “direct path”, because it leads “directly” to the realization of Nibbāna.^i40
This way of understanding also fits well with the final passage of the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta.
 Having stated that satipaṭṭhāna practice can lead to the two higher stages of realization within a maximum of seven years, the discourse closes with the declaration: “because of this, it has been said – this is the direct path”.
 This passage highlights ^pg42 the directness of satipaṭṭhāna, in the sense of its potential to lead to the highest stages of realization within a limited period of time.
term	^ya6(THE TERM SATIPAṬṬHĀNA)
The term satipaṭṭhāna can be explained as a compound of sati, “mindfulness” or “awareness”, and upaṭṭhāna, with the u of the latter term dropped by vowel elision.^i41
 The Pāli term upaṭṭhāna literally means “placing near”,^i42 and in the present context refers to a particular way of “being present” and “attending” to something with mindfulness.
 In the discourses, the corresponding verb upaṭṭhahati often denotes various nuances of “being present”,^i43 or else “attending”.^i44
 Understood in this way, “satipaṭṭhāna” means that sati “stands by”, in the sense of being present; sati is “ready at hand”, in the sense of attending to the current situation.
 Satipaṭṭhāna can then be translated as “presence of mindfulness” or as “attending with mindfulness”.^i45
	The commentaries, however, derive satipaṭṭhāna from the word “foundation” or “cause” (paṭṭhāna).^i46
 This seems unlikely, since in the discourses contained in the Pāli canon the corresponding verb paṭṭhahati never occurs together with sati.
 Moreover, the noun paṭṭhāna is not found at all in the early discourses, but comes into use only in the historically later Abhidhamma and the commentaries.^i47
 In contrast, the discourses frequently relate sati to the verb upaṭṭhahati, indicating that “presence” (upaṭṭhāna) is the etymologically correct ^pg43 derivation.^i48 In fact, the equivalent Sanskrit term is smòtyupasthāna, which shows that upasthāna, or its Pāli equivalent upaṭṭhāna, is the correct choice for the compound.^i49
	The problem with the commentarial explanation is that, instead of understanding satipaṭṭhāna as a particular attitude of being aware, satipaṭṭhāna becomes a “foundation” of mindfulness, the “cause” for the establishment of sati.
 This moves emphasis from the activity to the object.
 Yet these four satipaṭṭhānas are not the only possible cause or foundation for mindfulness, since in the Saḷāyatanavibhaṅga Sutta the Buddha spoke of three other satipaṭṭhānas, none of which corresponds to the four satipaṭṭhānas usually mentioned.^i50
 The three satipaṭṭhānas described by the Buddha on this occasion were his maintenance of mindfulness and equanimity as a teacher in regard to three different situations: none of the pupils paid attention, some paid attention and some not, and all paid attention.
 The fact that the Buddha nevertheless defined these three as satipaṭṭhānas shows that to speak of “satipaṭṭhāna” is less a question of the nature of the object that is chosen than of “attending” to whatever situation with a balanced attitude and with mindfulness being “present”.^pg44
definition	^yb(THE “DEFINITION” PART OF THE SATIPAṬṬHĀNA SUTTA)
This chapter and the next two are devoted to an examination of the “definition” part of the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta.
 This “definition”, which occurs also in other discourses as the standard way of defining right mindfulness (sammā sati), describes essential aspects of satipaṭṭhāna practice and therefore forms a key to understanding how the meditation techniques listed in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta are to be undertaken.
 The passage in question reads:
	^sutta Here, monks, in regard to the body a monk abides contemplating the body, diligent, clearly knowing, and mindful, free from desires and discontent in regard to the world.
In regard to feelings he abides contemplating feelings, diligent, clearly knowing, and mindful, free from desires and discontent in regard to the world.
In regard to the mind he abides contemplating the mind, diligent, clearly knowing, and mindful, free from desires and discontent in regard to the world.
In regard to dhammas he abides contemplating dhammas, diligent, clearly knowing, and mindful, free from desires and discontent in regard to the world.^i1
	In this chapter I will first take a look at the expression “contemplating” (anupassī) and consider why the objects of this contemplation ^pg45 are mentioned twice (for example, in regard to the body, one is to contemplate the body).
 I will then explore the significance of the first two qualities mentioned in the “definition”: “diligent” (ātāpī) and “clearly knowing” (sampajāna).
 The remaining qualities, mindfulness and the absence of desires and discontent, will be the subjects of Chapters III and IV.
contemplation	^yb1(CONTEMPLATION)
The “definition” of right mindfulness is concerned with “contemplating”.
 The corresponding Pāli verb anupassati can be derived from the verb “to see”, passati, and the emphatic prefix anu, so that anupassati means “to repeatedly look at”, that is, “to contemplate” or “to closely observe”.^i2
The discourses often speak of contemplation in order to describe a particular way of meditation, an examination of the observed object from a particular viewpoint.
 In the case of the body, for example, such observation can involve contemplating the body as impermanent (aniccānupassī, vayānupassī), and therefore as something which does not yield lasting satisfaction (dukkhānupassī);
 or as unattractive (asubhānupassī) and not-self (anattānupassī), and therefore as something to let go of (paṭinissaggānupassī).^i3
	These various forms of contemplation emphasize how the object is to be perceived.
 That is, as used in the discourses “contemplation” mplies that particular features of the object are to be given prominence, such as its impermanence, or its selfless nature.
 In the present context, however, the feature to be contemplated appears to be the same as the object of contemplation.
 Literally translated, one “contemplates body in body”, or “feelings in feelings”, etc.^i4
This slightly peculiar expression requires further consideration.^pg46
	Taking the first satipaṭṭhāna as an example, the instructions are: “in regard to the body abide contemplating the body”.
 Here, the first instance of “body” can be understood in the light of the satipaṭṭhāna “refrain”.
 The “refrain” explains that to contemplate the body applies to internal and external bodies.^i5
According to the commentaries, “internal” and “external” here represent one’s own and another person’s body.^i6
On this understanding, the first instance of “body” (in the locative case) could be translated as “where one’s own or another’s body is concerned”, or “in regard to one’s own or another’s body”, delineating the compass of this satipaṭṭhāna.
	For the second instance of “body”, the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta offers detailed specifications: to contemplate “body” can be undertaken by contemplating the breath, or the postures of the body, or activities of the body, or the anatomical constitution of the body, or the four elementary qualities of the body, or the decomposition of the body after death.
 Thus the second occurrence of “body” stands for a particular aspect from the general area of contemplation, a “sub-body” n the “overall body”, so to speak.^i7
	The satipaṭṭhāna “refrain” also contains additional information about the significance of “contemplation” in the present context.
 The same term is used, with the specification that the “arising” and the “passing away” of phenomena is the focus of contemplation.^i8
 That is, to speak of contemplation in the present context refers to directing awareness to the body and in particular to a specific feature of it, namely its impermanent nature.
	In drawing from other parts of the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, one can thus expand the somewhat puzzling instruction: “in the body abide contemplating the body” to read: “in regard to your own body or the bodies of others, direct awareness to its (or their) impermanent ^pg47 nature evident in different aspects of the body, such as the process of breathing, or its postures and activities, or its anatomical constitution, or its elementary qualities, or its decay at death.”
	According to the commentaries, the repetition of the object of contemplation also indicates emphasis, implying that the object of contemplation should be considered simply as perceived by the senses, and in particular without taking it to be “I” or “mine”.^i9
 In this way the repetition – body in body – underlines the importance of direct experience, as opposed to mere intellectual reflection.^i10
 One should let the body speak for itself, so to say, disclosing its true nature to the scrutiny of the meditator.
diligent	^yb2(THE SIGNIFICANCE OF BEING DILIGENT （ĀTĀPĪ）)
According to the “definition”, the practice of satipaṭṭhāna requires the establishment of four particular mental qualities (cf. Fig. 2.1 below), which can be taken to represent the mental faculties of energy, wisdom, mindfulness, and concentration.^i11
fig2.1	diligent(ātāpī)
clearly knowing(sampajāna)
mindful(sati)
free from desires and discontent (vineyya abhijjhādomanassa)
	^fig2.1(Key characteristics of satipaṭṭhāna)^pg48
The first of these four is the quality of diligence.
 The term diligent (ātāpī) is related to the word tapas, which connotes self-mortification and ascetic practices.
 The use of such vocabulary is surprising, since the Buddha did not consider self-mortification to be conducive to the realization of Nibbāna.^i12
 To better understand the Buddha’s position, the historical context should be considered.
	A substantial number of wandering ascetics in ancient India regarded self-mortification as the model path to purification.
 Jain and Ājīvika ascetics considered death by ritual suicide to be the ideal expression of successful realization.^i13
 Commonly accepted means for spiritual development were prolonged fasting, exposure to extremes of temperature, and the adoption of particularly painful postures.^i14
 Although the Buddha did not categorically reject such practices in their entirety,^i15 he openly criticized the belief that selfmortification was necessary for realization.^i16
	Before his awakening, the Buddha himself had been influenced by the belief that spiritual purification requires self-mortification.^i17
 Based on this mistaken belief, he had pursued ascetic practices to considerable extremes, without being able to realize awakening in this way.^i18
 He found ultimately that awakening does not depend on mere asceticism, but requires mental development, in particular the development of sati. ^i19
	Therefore, the form of “asceticism” the Buddha later taught was predominantly a mental one, characterized by a firm opposition to unwholesome thoughts and tendencies.^i20
 In an intriguing statement found in the discourses, the cultivation of the awakening factors is  ^pg49 referred to as the highest form of exertion.^i21
 Such subtler forms of “austerity” did not easily receive recognition by contemporary ascetics, and on several occasions the Buddha and his followers were ridiculed for their seemingly easy-going attitude.^i22
	Another point worth considering is that in ancient India there were a variety of deterministic and fatalistic teachings.^i23
 In contrast, the Buddha emphasized commitment and effort as essential requirements for achieving realization.
 According to him, only by way of desire, effort, and personal commitment can desirelessness be realized.^i24
 Effort, as an expression of wholesome desire, leads along the path until with full realization all desire will be abandoned.^i25
 In this context, the Buddha at times reinterpreted expressions commonly used within ascetic circles to express his own position.^i26^pg50
 The quality of being diligent (ātāpī) in the satipaṭṭhāna context appears to be one such instance.
	A different example of rather forceful vocabulary can be found in those passages in which the Buddha described his firm resolution prior to awakening: “let my flesh and blood dry up, I will not give up”,^i27 or “I will not change my posture unless realization has been gained”.^i28
 Concerning the resolve to refrain from changing posture, it needs to be kept in mind that the Buddha was able to achieve deep meditative absorption, so he could sit for long periods of time in the same posture without pain.^i29
 Thus what these expressions point to is not so much the endurance of a painful sitting posture as a strong and unwavering commitment.^i30
 Similar expressions are used by some of his disciples on the brink of realization.^i31
 Since the breakthrough to realization can only take place in a balanced state of mind, it might be best not to take these expressions too literally.
	In a similar way, the expression “diligent” (ātāpī) might not have carried the same literal connotations for the Buddha as it did for his more ascetically inclined contemporaries.
 In fact, in the Kāyagatāsati Sutta diligent (ātāpī) comes up in relation to experiencing the bliss of absorption.^i32
 Similarly, in a passage from the Indriya Saṃyutta the quality of diligence is combined with pleasant feelings, mental and physical.^i33
 In these instances, “diligent” has clearly lost any relation to self-mortification and its concomitant physical pain.
	Since both deficiency of effort and excessive tension can obstruct one’s progress,^i34 the quality of “diligence” is best understood as a ^pg51 balanced but sustained application of energy.^i35
 Such balanced endeavour avoids, on the one hand, passive submission to “destiny”, a higher will, or personal idiosyncrasies, and on the other, excessive effort, self-assertive striving, and self-inflicted suffering in the name of a higher goal.
	The Buddha once compared the balanced effort needed for proper progress to the tuning of a lute, whose strings should be neither too tight nor too loose.^i36
 This comparison of mental cultivation to the tuning of a musical instrument illustrates the well-adjusted effort and sensitivity required for the development of the mind.^i37
 The notion of a “middle path” of wise balance, avoiding the extremes of excessive and insufficient effort, has of course been one of the Buddha’s central teachings since the time of his first discourse.^i38
 It was this balanced “middle path” approach, avoiding the two extremes of stagnation and excessive striving, which had enabled him to gain awakening.^i39
	The practical implications of being “diligent” can best be illustrated with two maxims from the discourses, both of which use the word diligent (ātāpī): “right now is the time to practise diligently”,^pg52 and “you yourself have to practise with diligence.”^i40
 Similar connotations underlie the occurrence of the quality of “diligence” in those passages that describe the serious commitment of a monk who retires into seclusion for intensive practice after having received a brief instruction from the Buddha.^i41
	Applying these nuances to satipaṭṭhāna, to be “diligent” then amounts to keeping up one’s contemplation with balanced but dedicated continuity, returning to the object of meditation as soon as it is lost.^i42
clearly knowing	^yb3(CLEARLY KNOWING （SAMPAJĀNA）)
The second of the four mental qualities mentioned in the “definition” is sampajāna, a present participle of the verb sampajānāti.
 Sampajānāti can be divided into pajānāti (he or she knows) and the prefix saṃ (together), which often serves an intensifying function in Pāli compounds.^i43
 Thus sam-pajānāti stands for an intensified form of knowing, for “clearly knowing”.^i44
	The range of meaning of “clearly knowing” (sampajāna) can be conveniently illustrated by briefly surveying some of its occurrences in the discourses.
 In a discourse found in the Dīgha Nikāya, clearly knowing stands for consciously experiencing one’s own life as an embryo in a womb, including the event of being born.^i45
 In the Majjhima Nikāya one finds clearly knowing representing the presence of deliberateness, when one “deliberately” speaks a falsehood.^i46
 In a passage from the Saṃyutta Nikāya, clearly knowing refers to awareness of the impermanent nature of feelings and thoughts.^i47
 A discourse in the Aṅguttara Nikāya recommends clear ^pg53 knowledge (sampajañña) for overcoming unwholesomeness and establishing wholesomeness.^i48
 Finally, the Itivuttaka relates clearly knowing to following the advice of a good friend.^i49
	A common denominator suggested by these examples selected from all five Nikāyas is the ability to fully grasp or comprehend what is taking place.
 Such clear knowledge can in turn lead to the development of wisdom (paññā).
 According to the Abhidhamma, clear knowledge does in fact already represent the presence of wisdom.^i50
 Considered from an etymological viewpoint, this suggestion is convincing, since paññā and (sam-)pajānāti are closely related.
 But a close examination of the above examples suggests that clearly knowing (sampajāna) does not necessarily imply the presence of wisdom (paññā).
 When one utters a falsehood, for example, one might clearly know one’s speech to be a lie, but one does not speak the falsehood “with wisdom”.
 Similarly, while it is remarkable enough to be clearly aware of one’s embryonic development in the womb, to do so does not require wisdom.
 Thus, though clear knowing might lead to the development of wisdom, in itself it only connotes “to clearly know” what is happening.
	In the satipaṭṭhāna instructions, the presence of such clear knowledge is alluded to by the frequently recurring expression “he knows” (pajānāti), which is found in most of the practical instructions.
 Similar to clearly knowing, the expression “he knows” (pajānāti) at times refers to rather basic forms of knowing, while in other instances it connotes more sophisticated types of understanding.
 In the context of satipaṭṭhāna, the range of what a meditator “knows” includes, for example, identifying a long breath as long, or recognizing one’s physical posture.^i51
 But with the later satipaṭṭhāna contemplations, the meditator’s task of knowing evolves until it comes to include the presence of discriminative understanding, ^pg54 such as when one is to understand the arising of a fetter in dependence on a sense door and its respective object.^i52 This evolution culminates in knowing the four noble truths “as they actually are”, a penetrative type of deep understanding for which again the expression “he knows” is used.^i53
 Thus both the expression “he knows” (pajānāti) and the quality of “clearly knowing” (sampajāna) can range from basic forms of knowing to deep discriminative understanding.
clear knowlege	^yb4(MINDFULNESS AND CLEAR KNOWLEDGE)
Clearly knowing, apart from being listed in the “definition” part of the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, is mentioned again under the first satipaṭṭhāna, with regard to a set of bodily activities.^i54 Expositions of the gradual path of training usually refer to such clear knowing in regard to bodily activities with the compound satisampajañña, “mindfulness and clear knowledge”.^i55
 On further perusing the discourses one finds that this combination of mindfulness with clear knowledge (or clearly knowing) is employed in a wide variety of contexts, paralleling the above documented flexible usage of clearly knowing on its own.
	The Buddha, for instance, taught his disciples, went to sleep, endured an illness, relinquished his life-principle, and prepared for death – each time endowed with mindfulness and clear knowledge.^i56
 Even in his previous life he was already in possession of mindfulness and clear knowledge when he arose in heaven, stayed there, passed away from there, and entered his mother’s womb.^i57
	Mindfulness and clear knowledge also contribute towards improving one’s ethical conduct and overcoming sensuality.^i58
 In the^pg55 context of meditation, mindfulness and clear knowledge can refer to contemplating feelings and thoughts; they can mark a high level of equanimity in the context of perceptual training; or they can take part in overcoming sloth-and-torpor.^i59
 Mindfulness and clear knowledge become particularly prominent during the third meditative absorption (jhāna), where the presence of both is required to avoid a relapse into the intense joy (pīti) experienced during the second absorption.^i60
	This broad variety of occurrences demonstrates that the combination of mindfulness with clear knowledge is often used in a general manner to refer to awareness and knowledge,
 without being restricted to its specific use as clearly knowing bodily activities in the gradual path scheme or in the satipaṭṭhāna context of body contemplation.
	Such cooperation of mindfulness with clear knowledge, which according to the “definition” is required for all satipaṭṭhāna contemplations, points to the need to combine mindful observation of phenomena with an intelligent processing of the observed data.
 Thus “to clearly know” can be taken to represent the “illuminating” r “awakening” aspect of contemplation.
 Understood in this way, clear knowledge has the task of processing the input gathered by mindful observation, and thereby leads to the arising of wisdom.^i61
	These qualities of clear knowledge and mindfulness thus remind one of the development of “knowledge” and “vision” of reality (yathābhūtañāṇadassana).
 According to the Buddha, to both “know” nd “see” are necessary conditions for the realization of Nibbāna. ^i62 It might not be too far-fetched to relate such growth of knowledge (ñāṇa) to the quality of clearly knowing (sampajāna), and the accompanying aspect of “vision” (dassana) to the activity of watching represented by mindfulness (sati).^pg56
	More remains to be said about this quality of clear knowledge.^i63 In order to do this, however, some additional ground has to be covered, such as examining in more detail the implications of sati, which I will do in Chapter III.^pg57
sati	^yc(SATI)
In this chapter I continue to investigate the “definition” part of the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta.
 As a way of providing some background for sati, the third quality mentioned in the “definition”, I briefly survey the general approach to knowledge in early Buddhism.
 In order to evaluate sati as a mental quality, the main task of the present chapter, I go on to explore its typical characteristics from different angles, and also contrast it with concentration (samādhi).
early approach	^yc1(THE EARLY BUDDHIST APPROACH TO KNOWLEDGE)
The philosophical setting of ancient India was influenced by three main approaches to the acquisition of knowledge.^i1
 The Brahmins relied mainly on ancient sayings, handed down by oral transmission, as authoritative sources of knowledge; while in the Upaniṣads one finds philosophical reasoning used as a central tool for developing knowledge.
 In addition to these two, a substantial number of the wandering ascetics and contemplatives of that time considered extrasensory perception and intuitive knowledge, gained through meditative experiences, as important means for the acquisition of knowledge.
 These three approaches can be summarized as: oral tradition, logical reasoning, and direct intuition.
	When questioned on his own epistemological position, the Buddha placed himself in the third category, i.e. among those who^pg58 emphasized the development of direct, personal knowledge.^i2
 Although he did not completely reject oral tradition or logical reasoning as ways of acquiring knowledge, he was keenly aware of their limitations.
 The problem with oral tradition is that material committed to memory might be wrongly remembered.
 Moreover, even material that has been well remembered might be false and misleading.
	Similarly, logical reasoning might seem convincing, but then turn out to be unsound.
 Moreover, even sound reasoning might prove false and misleading if it is based on false premises.
 On the other hand, what has not been well remembered or what does not appear to be perfectly well reasoned might turn out to be true.^i3
 Similar reservations hold true for direct knowledge gained in meditation.
 In fact, according to the Buddha’s penetrating analysis in the Brahmajāla Sutta, sole reliance on direct extrasensory knowledge had caused a considerable number of mistaken views among contemporary practitioners.^i4
 The Buddha once illustrated the dangers of relying entirely on one’s own direct experience with the help of a parable.
 In this parable, a king had several blind men each touch a different part of an elephant.^i5
 When questioned on the nature of the elephant, each blind man gave an entirely different account as the only right and true description of an elephant.
 Although what was experienced by each of the blind men was empirically true, yet their personal direct experience had revealed only part of the picture.
 The mistake each made was to wrongly conclude that his direct knowledge gained through personal experience was the only truth, so that anyone disagreeing must be mistaken.^i6
	This parable goes to show that even direct personal experience might reveal only a part of the picture and therefore should not be grasped dogmatically as an absolute ground for knowledge.
 That is,^pg59 emphasis on direct experience need not entail a complete rejection of oral tradition and reasoning as auxiliary sources of knowledge.
Nevertheless, direct experience constitutes the central epistemological tool in early Buddhism.
 According to a passage in the Saḷāyatana Saṃyutta, it is in particular the practice of satipaṭṭhāna that can lead to an undistorted direct experience of things as they truly are, independent of oral tradition and reasoning.^i7
Thus, clearly, satipaṭṭhāna is an empirical tool of central importance in the pragmatic theory of knowledge in early Buddhism.
	Applying the epistemological position of early Buddhism to actual practice, oral tradition and reasoning, in the sense of some degree of knowledge and reflection about the Dhamma, form the supporting conditions for a direct experience of reality through the practice of satipaṭṭhāna.^i8
sati 2	^yc2(SATI)
The noun sati is related to the verb sarati, to remember.^i9
 Sati in the sense of “memory” occurs on several occasions in the discourses,^i10
 and also in the standard definitions of sati given in the Abhidhamma and the commentaries.^i11
 This remembrance aspect of sati is personified by the Buddha’s disciple most eminent in sati, Ānanda, who is credited with the almost incredible feat of recalling all the discourses spoken by the Buddha.^i12
	The connotation of sati as memory becomes particularly prominent with the recollections (anussati).
 The discourses often list a set of six recollections: recollection of the Buddha, of the Dhamma, of^pg60 the Saṅgha, of one’s ethical conduct, of one’s liberality, and of heavenly beings (devas).^i13
 Another kind of recollection, usually occurring in the context of the “higher knowledges” gained through deep concentration, is the recollection of one’s past lives (pubbenivāsānussati).
 In regard to all these, it is sati that fulfils the function of recollecting.^i14
 This recollective function of sati can even lead to awakening, documented in the Theragāthā with the case of a monk who gained realization based on recollecting the qualities of the Buddha.^i15
	This connotation of sati as memory appears also in its formal definition in the discourses, which relates sati to the ability of calling to mind what has been done or said long ago.^i16
 A closer examination of this definition, however, reveals that sati is not really defined as memory, but as that which facilitates and enables memory.
 What this definition of sati points to is that, if sati is present, memory will be able to function well.^i17
	Understanding sati in this way facilitates relating it to the context of satipaṭṭhāna, where it is not concerned with recalling past events, but functions as awareness of the present moment.^i18
 In the context of satipaṭṭhāna meditation, it is due to the presence of sati that one is ^pg61 able to remember what is otherwise only too easily forgotten: the present moment.
	Sati as present moment awareness is similarly reflected in the presentations of the Paṭisambhidāmagga and the Visuddhimagga,
 according to which the characteristic quality of sati is “presence” (upaṭṭhāna),
 whether as a faculty (indriya), as an awakening factor (bojjhaṅga), as a factor of the noble eightfold path, or at the moment of realization.^i19
	Thus mindfulness being present (upaṭṭhitasati) can be understood to imply presence of mind, in so far as it is directly opposed to absent-mindedness (muṭṭhassati);
 presence of mind in the sense that, endowed with sati, one is wide awake in regard to the present moment.^i20
 Owing to such presence of mind, whatever one does or says will be clearly apprehended by the mind, and thus can be more easily remembered later on.^i21
	Sati is required not only to fully take in the moment to be remembered, but also to bring this moment back to mind at a later time.
 To “re-collect”, then, becomes just a particular instance of a state of mind characterized by “collectedness” and the absence of distraction.^i22
 This twofold character of sati can also be found in some verses in the Sutta Nipāta, which instruct the listener to set out with sati, subsequent to an instruction given by the Buddha.^i23
 In these instances sati seems to combine both present moment awareness and remembering what the Buddha had taught.
	The kind of mental state in which memory functions well can be characterized by a certain degree of breadth, in contrast to a narrow focus.
 It is this breadth that enables the mind to make the necessary connections between information received in the present moment and information to be remembered from the past.
 This quality becomes evident on those occasions when one tries to recall a particular instance or fact, but where the more one applies one’s mind, the less one is able to remember it.
 But if the issue in question is laid aside for a while and the mind is in a state of relaxed receptivity, the^pg62 information one was trying to remember will suddenly spring to mind.
	The suggestion that the mental state in which sati is wellestablished can be characterized as having “breadth” instead of a narrow focus finds support in some discourses which relate the absence of sati to a narrow state of mind (parittacetasa), while its presence leads to a broad and even “boundless” state of mind (appamāṇacetasa).^i24
 Based on this nuance of “breadth of mind”, sati can be understood to represent the ability to simultaneously maintain in one’s mind the various elements and facets of a particular situation.^i25
 This can be applied to both the faculty of memory and to awareness of the present moment.
role and position	^yc3(THE ROLE AND POSITION OF SATI)
More understanding about sati can be gained by considering its role and position among some of the central categories of early Buddhism (cf. Fig. 3.1 below).
 Sati not only forms part of the noble eightfold path – as right mindfulness (sammā sati) – but also occupies a central position among the faculties (indriya) and powers (bala), and constitutes the first member of the awakening factors (bojjhaṅga).
 In these contexts, the functions of sati cover both present moment awareness and memory.^i26^pg63
fig3.1	faculties + powers noble eightfold path awakening factors 
confidence right view sati 
energy right thought investigation-of-dhammas 
sati right speech energy 
concentration right action joy 
wisdom right livelihood tranquillity 
right effort concentration 
sammā sati equanimity 
right concentration 
^fig3.1(The position of sati among important categories) 
	Among the faculties (indriya) and powers (bala), sati occupies the middle position.
 Here sati has the function of balancing and monitoring the other faculties and powers, by becoming aware of excesses or deficiencies.
 A monitoring function similar to its position among the faculties and powers can be found in the noble eightfold path, where sati occupies the middle position in the three-factored path section directly concerned with mental training.
 The monitoring quality of sati is however not restricted to right effort and right concentration only, since according to the Mahācattārīsaka Sutta the presence of right mindfulness is also a requirement for the other path factors.^i27
	In regard to its two neighbours in the noble eightfold path, sati performs additional functions.
 In support of right effort sati performs a protective role by preventing the arising of unwholesome states of mind in the context of sense-restraint, which in fact constitutes an aspect of right effort.
 In relation to right concentration, well-established sati acts as an important foundation for the development of deeper levels of mental calm, a topic to which I will return later on.
	This position of sati in between the two mental qualities of energy (or effort) and concentration recurs also among the faculties and ^pg64 powers.
 The “definition” part of the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta also combines sati with these two qualities, which are here represented by being diligent (ātāpī) and by the absence of desires and discontent (abhijjhādomanassa).
 The placement of sati between energy and concentration in all these contexts mirrors a natural progression in the development of sati, since in the early stages of practice a considerable degree of energy is required to counter distraction, while well-established sati in turn leads to an increasingly concentrated and calm state of mind.
	In contrast to its middle position among the faculties and powers, and in the final section of the noble eightfold path, in the list of the awakening factors sati assumes the starting position.
 Here sati constitutes the foundation for those factors that bring about realization.
	Since in relation to the faculties, powers, and factors of the noble eightfold path sati is clearly distinguished from associated factors like energy, wisdom, and concentration, sati has to be something clearly different from them in order to merit separate listing.^i28
 Similarly, since sati is differentiated from the awakening factor “investigation-of-dhammas”, the task of investigating dhammas cannot be identical with the activity of awareness, otherwise there would have been no need to introduce it as a separate term.
 In this case, however, the activity of sati is closely related to “investigation-ofdhammas”, since according to the Ānāpānasati Sutta the awakening factors arise sequentially, with “investigation-of-dhammas” arising consequent on the presence of sati. ^i29
	Coming back to right mindfulness as a factor of the noble eightfold path, it is noteworthy that the term sati is repeated within the definition of right mindfulness (sammā sati).^i30
 This repetition is not merely accidental, but rather points to a qualitative distinction between “right” mindfulness (sammā sati) as a path factor and mindfulness as ^pg65 a general mental factor.
 In fact, numerous discourses mention “wrong” mindfulness (micchā sati), which suggests that certain forms of sati can be quite different from right mindfulness.^i31
 According to this definition, sati requires the support of being diligent (ātāpī) and of clearly knowing (sampajāna).
 It is this combination of mental qualities, supported by a state of mind free from desires and discontent, and directed towards the body, feelings, the mind, and dhammas, which becomes the path factor of right mindfulness.
	In the Maṇibhadda Sutta the Buddha pointed out that sati on its own, despite its manifold advantages, might not suffice for eradicating ill will.^i32
 This passage indicates that additional factors are needed in combination with sati, such as being diligent and clearly knowing in the case of developing satipaṭṭhāna.
	Thus, in order to constitute “right mindfulness”, sati has to cooperate with various other mental qualities.
 However, for the purpose of clearly defining sati, which is my present task, I will consider sati in isolation from these other mental factors in order to discern its most essential features.^pg66
imagery	^yc4(SATI IMAGERY)
The significance and various nuances of the term sati are illustrated by a considerable number of images and similes in the discourses.
 If these images and similes are examined and their implications drawn out, additional insights can be gained into how the Buddha and his contemporaries understood the term sati.
	A simile in the Dvedhāvitakka Sutta describes a cowherd who had to watch closely over his cows to prevent them straying into fields where the crop was ripe.
 But once the crop was harvested, he was able to relax, sit under a tree, and watch over them from a distance.
 To express this comparatively relaxed and distant manner of observation, sati is used.^i33
 The disposition suggested by this simile is a calm and detached type of observation.
	Another simile supporting this quality of detached observation occurs in a verse in the Theragāthā, which compares the practice of satipaṭṭhāna to climbing an elevated platform or tower.^i34
 Connotations of aloofness and uninvolved detachment are confirmed by the context of this passage, which contrasts the tower image to being carried away by the stream of desire.
 Detachment comes up again in the Dantabhūmi Sutta, which compares satipaṭṭhāna to the taming of a wild elephant.
 Just as a recently captured elephant has to be gradually weaned of his forest habits, so too satipaṭṭhāna can gradually wean a monk from memories and intentions related to the household life.^i35
	Another simile compares sati to the probe of a surgeon.^i36
 Like the surgeon’s probe, whose function is to provide information about the wound for subsequent treatment, so too the “probe” sati can be used to carefully gather information, thereby preparing the ground for subsequent action.
 This ground-preparing quality is conveyed again by another simile, relating sati to the goad and the ploughshare of a farmer.^i37
 Just as a farmer has first to plough the ground in^pg67 order to be able to sow, so too sati fulfils an important preparatory role for the arising of wisdom.^i38
	This role of sati in support of the arising of wisdom occurs again in another simile, which associates the parts of an elephant’s body with mental qualities and factors.
 Here sati is compared to the elephant’s neck, the natural support for its head, which in the same simile represents wisdom.^i39
 The choice of the elephant’s neck is of additional significance, since it is a characteristic of both elephants and Buddhas to look around by turning with the whole body instead of only with the head.^i40
 The elephant’s neck, then, represents the quality of giving full attention to a matter at hand as a feature of sati.
	Although the “elephant look” is a specific characteristic of the Buddha, to give continuous and full attention to a matter at hand is a characteristic common to all arahants.^i41 
 This is illustrated in another simile, which compares sati to the single spoke of a chariot.^i42
 In this simile, the rolling chariot represents the bodily activities of an arahant, all of which take place with the support of a single spoke – sati.^pg68
	The supportive role of sati in the development of wisdom comes up again in a verse from the Sutta Nipāta, where sati keeps the streams in this world in check, so that the faculty of wisdom can cut them off.^i43
 This verse points in particular to the role of sati in relation to restraint at the sense doors (indriya saṃvara) as a basis for the development of wisdom.
	What the similes of the “surgeon’s probe”, the “ploughshare”, the “elephant’s neck”, and “keeping the streams in check” have in common is that they illustrate the preparatory role of sati for insight.
 According to these similes, sati is the mental quality that enables wisdom to arise.^i44
	Another simile, found in the Saṃyutta Nikāya, compares sati to a careful charioteer.^i45
 This brings to mind the monitoring and steering quality of sati in relation to other mental factors, such as the faculties and the powers.
 The qualities evoked by this simile are careful and balanced supervision.
 A similar nuance can be found in another simile, which compares mindfulness in relation to the body to carrying a bowl full of oil on one’s head, vividly illustrating the balancing quality of sati.^i46
	The quality of careful supervision occurs again in yet another simile, in which sati is personified by the gatekeeper of a town.^i47
 The simile portrays messengers arriving at the town gate with an urgent message to be delivered to the king.
 The function of the gatekeeper is to inform them of the shortest route to the king.
 The gatekeeper image occurs again elsewhere in relation to the defence of a town.
 This town has energy (viriya) as its troops and wisdom (paññā) as its fortification, while the function of the gatekeeper sati is to recognize the genuine citizens of the town and to allow them to enter the gates.^i48
 Both of these similes associate sati with having a clear ^pg69 overview of the situation.^i49
	The second simile moreover brings out the restraining function of bare sati, a function which is of particular relevance in relation to restraint at the sense doors (indriya saævara).
 This brings to mind the above-mentioned passage where sati was to keep the streams in this world in check.
 Just as the presence of the gatekeeper prevents those not entitled from entering the town, so too the presence of well-established sati prevents the arising of unwholesome associations and reactions at the sense doors.
 The same protective role of sati also underlies other passages, which introduce sati as the one factor that guards the mind,^i50 or as a mental quality able to exert a controlling influence on thoughts and intentions^i51
	A discourse in the Aṅguttara Nikāya compares the practice of satipaṭṭhāna to a cowherd’s skill in knowing the proper pasture for his cows.^i52
 The image of a proper pasture occurs again in the Mahā-gopālaka Sutta, throwing into relief the importance of satipaṭṭhāna contemplation for growth and development on the path to deliverance.^i53
 Another discourse employs the same image to describe the situation of a monkey who has to avoid straying into regions visited by hunters.^i54
 Just as the monkey, wishing to be safe, has to keep to its proper pasture, so too practitioners of the path should keep to their proper pasture, which is satipaṭṭhāna.
 Since one of the above passages explains sensual pleasures to be an improper “pasture”, this set of images depicting satipaṭṭhāna as one’s proper pasture points to the restraining role of bare awareness in regard to sense-input.^i55^pg70
	This stabilizing function of established mindfulness in regard to distraction by way of the six sense doors is exemplified in another simile by a strong post, to which six different wild animals are bound.^i56
 No matter how much each animal might struggle to get off on its own, the “strong post” sati will remain stable and unshaken.
 Such a stabilizing function of sati is of particular relevance during the initial stages of satipaṭṭhāna practice, given that without a firm foundation in balanced awareness one only too easily succumbs to sensual distraction.
 This danger is illustrated in the Cātumā Sutta, which describes a monk who goes begging alms without having established sati and therefore without restraint at the sense doors.
 Encountering a scantily clad woman on his tour causes sensual desire to arise in his mind, so that he eventually decides to give up his practice and to disrobe.^i57
functions	^yc5(CHARACTERISTICS AND FUNCTIONS OF SATI)
A close examination of the instructions in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta reveals that the meditator is never instructed to interfere actively with what happens in the mind.
 If a mental hindrance arises, for example, the task of satipaṭṭhāna contemplation is to know that the hindrance is present, to know what has led to its arising, and to know what will lead to its disappearance.
 A more active intervention is no longer the domain of satipaṭṭhāna, but belongs rather to the province of right effort (sammā vāyāma).
	The need to distinguish clearly between a first stage of observation and a second stage of taking action is, according to the Buddha, an essential feature of his way of teaching.^i58
 The simple reason for this approach is that only the preliminary step of calmly assessing a situation without immediately reacting enables one to undertake the appropriate action.
	Thus, although sati furnishes the necessary information for a wise deployment of right effort, and will monitor the countermeasures by noting if these are excessive or deficient, sati nevertheless^pg71 remains an aloof quality of uninvolved, detached observation.
 Sati can interact with other, much more active factors of the mind, yet by itself it does not interfere.^i59
	Uninvolved and detached receptivity as one of the crucial characteristics of sati forms an important aspect in the teachings of several modern meditation teachers and scholars.^i60
 They emphasize that the purpose of sati is solely to make things conscious, not to eliminate them.
 Sati silently observes, like a spectator at a play, without in any way interfering.
 Some refer to this non-reactive feature of sati as“choiceless” awareness.^i61
 “Choiceless” in the sense that with such awareness one remains impartially aware, without reacting with likes or dislikes.
 Such silent and non-reactive observation can at times suffice to curb unwholesomeness, so that an application of sati can have quite active consequences.
 Yet sati’s activity is confined to detached observation.
 That is, sati does not change experience, it deepens it.
	This non-interfering quality ofsati is required to enable one clearly to observe the building up of reactions and their underlying motives.
 As soon as one becomes in any way involved in a reaction, the detached observational vantage point is immediately lost.
 The detached receptivity of sati enables one to step back from the situation at hand and thereby to become an unbiased observer of one’s subjective involvement and of the entire situation.^i62
 This detached distance allows for a more objective perspective, a characteristic illustrated in the above-mentioned simile of climbing a tower.
	This detached but receptive stance of satipaṭṭhāna constitutes a “middle path”, since it avoids the two extremes of suppression and reaction.^i63
 The receptivity of sati, in the absence of both suppression and reaction, allows personal shortcomings and unjustified reactions to unfold before the watchful stance of the meditator, without^pg72 being suppressed by the affective investment inherent in one’s self-image.
 Maintaining the presence of sati in this way is closely related to the ability to tolerate a high degree of “cognitive dissonance”, since the witnessing of one’s own shortcomings ordinarily leads to unconscious attempts at reducing the resulting feeling of discomfort by avoiding or even altering the perceived information.^i64
	This shift towards a more objective and uninvolved perspective introduces an important element of sobriety into self-observation.
 The element of “sobriety” inherent in the presence of sati comes up in an entertaining canonical description of a particular celestial realm, whose divine inhabitants get so “intoxicated” with sensual indulgence that they lose all sati.
 As a consequence of being without sati, they fall from their elevated celestial position and are reborn in a lower realm.^i65
 The reverse case is also documented in another discourse, in which negligent monks, reborn in an inferior celestial realm, on regaining their sati are at once able to ascend to a higher realm.^i66
 Both these instances point to the edifying power of sati and its wholesome repercussions.
	Sati as a mental quality is closely related to attention (manasikāra), a basic function which, according to the Abhidhammic analysis, is present in any kind of mental state.^i67
 This basic faculty of ordinary attention characterizes the initial split seconds of bare cognizing of an object, before one begins to recognize, identify, and conceptualize.
 Sati can be understood as a further development and temporal extension of this type of attention, thereby adding clarity and depth to the usually much too short fraction of time occupied by bare attention in the perceptual process.^i68
 The resemblance in function between sati and attention is also reflected in the fact that wise attention (yoniso manasikāra) parallels several aspects of satipaṭṭhāna contemplation, such as directing attention to antidotes for the hindrances, becoming aware of the impermanent nature of the^pg73 aggregates or of the sense-spheres, establishing the awakening factors, and contemplating the four noble truths.^i69
	This “bare attention” aspect of sati has an intriguing potential, since it is capable of leading to a “de-automatization” of mental mechanisms.^i70
 Through bare sati one is able to see things just as they are, unadulterated by habitual reactions and projections.
 By bringing the perceptual process into the full light of awareness, one becomes conscious of automatic and habitual responses to perceptual data.
 Full awareness of these automatic responses is the necessary preliminary step to changing detrimental mental habits.
	Sati as bare attention is particularly relevant to restraint at the sense doors (indriya saṃvara).^i71
 In this aspect of the gradual path, the practitioner is encouraged to retain bare sati in regard to all senseinput.
 Through the simple presence of undisrupted and bare mindfulness, the mind is “restrained” from amplifying and proliferating the received information in various ways.
 This guardianship role of sati in relation to sense-input is alluded to in those similes that declare satipaṭṭhāna to be the proper “pasture” for a meditator and which compare sati to the gatekeeper of a town.
	According to the discourses, the purpose of restraining the senses is to avoid the arising of desires (abhijjhā) and discontent (domanassa).
 Such freedom from desires and discontent is also an aspect of satipaṭṭhāna contemplation, mentioned in the “definition” art of the discourse.^i72
 Thus the absence of reactions under the influence of desires and discontent is a common feature of both satipaṭṭhāna and sense-restraint.
 This goes to show that there is a considerable degree of overlap between these two activities.
	To sum up, sati entails an alert but receptive equanimous observation.^i73
 Viewed from the context of actual practice, a predominantly receptive sati is then enlivened by the quality of being diligent ^pg74 (ātāpī), and supported by a foundation in concentration (samādhi).
 To the interrelation of sati with concentration I will now turn in more detail.
concentration	^yc6(SATI AND CONCENTRATION （SAMĀDHI）)
The continuous presence of well-established sati is a requirement for absorption (jhāna).^i74
 Without the support of sati, as the Visuddhimagga points out, concentration cannot reach the level of absorption.^i75
 Even on emerging from an experience of deep concentration sati is required when one reviews the constituent factors of one’s experience.^i76
 Thus sati is relevant for attaining, for remaining in, and for emerging from deep concentration.^i77
	Sati becomes particularly prominent when the third level of absorption (jhāna) is reached.^i78
 With the attainment of the fourth absorption, when the mind has reached such a degree of proficiency that it can be directed towards the development of supernormal powers, sati also reaches a high degree of purity, because of its association with deep equanimity.^i79
	Several discourses testify to the important role of satipaṭṭhāna as a basis for the development of absorption and for the subsequent ^pg75 attainment of supernormal powers.^i80
 The role of satipaṭṭhāna in supporting the development of concentration is also reflected in the standard expositions of the gradual path, where the preliminary steps that lead up to the attainment of absorption include mindfulness and clear knowledge (satisampajañña) in relation to bodily activities,
 and the task of recognizing the hindrances and supervising their removal, an aspect of the fourth satipaṭṭhāna, contemplation of dhammas.
	The progression from satipaṭṭhāna to absorption is described in the Dantabhūmi Sutta with an intermediate step.
 In this intermediate step, contemplation of the body, feelings, mind, and dhammas continues with the specific qualification that one should avoid having any thoughts.^i81
 In the instruction for this transitional stage, the mental qualities of diligence and clear knowledge are conspicuously absent.
 Their absence suggests that at this point the contemplation is no longer satipaṭṭhāna proper, but only a transitional stage.
 This thought-free transitional stage still partakes of the same receptive observational quality and of the same object as satipaṭṭhāna, but at the same time it marks a clear shift from insight to calm.
 It is subsequent to this shift of emphasis from satipaṭṭhāna proper to a state of calm awareness that the development of absorption can take place.
	On considering these instances it is indubitably clear that sati has a crucial role to fulfil in the realm of samatha.
 This might be why the Cūḷavedalla Sutta speaks of satipaṭṭhāna as the “cause” of concentration (samādhinimitta).^i82
 The relation between satipaṭṭhāna and the development of deep concentration is exemplified by the monk^pg76 Anuruddha, foremost among the Buddha’s disciples in the supernormal ability of seeing beings in other realms of existence,^i83 an ability based on a high degree of proficiency in concentration.
 Whenever asked about his abilities, Anuruddha invariably explained that his skills were the outcome of his practice of satipaṭṭhāna.^i84
	On the other hand, however, to consider satipaṭṭhāna purely as a concentration exercise goes too far and misses the important difference between what can become a basis for the development of concentration and what belongs to the realm of calmness meditation proper.^i85
 In fact, the characteristic functions of sati and concentration (samādhi) are quite distinct.
 While concentration corresponds to an enhancement of the selective function of the mind, by way of restricting the breadth of attention, sati on its own represents an enhancement of the recollective function, by way of expanding the breadth of attention.^i86
 These two modes of mental functioning correspond to two different cortical control mechanisms in the brain.^i87
 This difference, however, does not imply that the two are incompatible, since during absorption attainment both are present.
 But during absorption sati becomes mainly presence of the mind, when it to some extent loses its natural breadth owing to the strong focusing power of concentration.
	The difference between these two becomes evident from the vocabulary employed in a passage from the Satipaṭṭhāna Saṃyutta.^pg77
In this passage the Buddha recommended that, if one is being distracted or sluggish while practising satipaṭṭhāna, one should temporarily change one’s practice and develop a calm (samatha) object of meditation, in order to cultivate internal joy and serenity.^i88
	This he termed a “directed” form of meditation (paṇidhāya bhāvanā).
 Once, however, the mind has been calmed, one can return to an “undirected” mode of meditation (appaṇidhāya bhāvanā), namely the practice of satipaṭṭhāna.
 The distinction drawn in this discourse between “directed” and “undirected” forms of meditation suggests that, considered on their own, these two modes of meditation are clearly different.
 At the same time, however, the whole discourse is concerned with their skilful interrelation, clearly demonstrating that whatever the degree of their difference, the two can be interrelated and support each other.^i89
	The characteristic quality of concentration is to “direct” and apply the mind, focusing on a single object to the exclusion of everything else.
 Thus the development of concentration promotes a shift from the common structure of experience as a subject-object duality towards an experience of unity.^i90
 Concentration, however, thereby excludes a broader awareness of circumstances and of their interrelations.^i91
 This awareness of circumstances and interrelations is, however, essential in order to become aware of those characteristics of experience whose understanding leads to awakening.
 In this context, the broadly receptive quality of sati is particularly important.
	These two rather distinct qualities of concentration and mindfulness are combined to some extent in the descriptions of insight meditation by those meditation teachers who emphasize the “dry insight” approach, dispensing with the formal development of mental calm.
 They sometimes describe sati as “attacking” its object in a^pg78 way that is comparable to a stone hitting a wall.^i92
 These forceful terms probably represent the need for a considerable degree of effort during contemplation, such prodigious effort being required to compensate for the comparatively low degree of concentration developed when following the “dry insight” approach to awakening.
 In fact, some of these same meditation teachers consider the bare and equanimous qualities of sati as a more evolved stage of practice, presumably when the more forceful stage of “attacking” an object has fulfilled its role and has provided a basis of mental stability.^i93
	The above way of considering sati may be related to the commentarial definition of sati as “non-floating” and therefore as “plunging into its object”.^i94
 Certainly the absence of “floating”, in the sense of distraction, is a characteristic of sati.
 However “to plunge” into an object appears to be more characteristic of concentration, particularly during the progress towards absorption.
 According to modern scholarship, it seems that this aspect of the commentarial understanding of sati arose because of a misreading or misinterpretation of a particular term.^i95
 In fact, “attacking” an object or “plunging into” an object do not correspond to the characteristic features of sati in itself, but represent sati in a secondary role, acting in combination with effort or concentration.
	Thus although it plays an important part in the development of absorption, considered on its own sati is a mental quality distinct from concentration.
 Indeed, the reason even the attainment of high levels of absorption by itself is insufficient for liberating insight is quite probably related to the inhibition of the passive observational^pg79 qualities of awareness by the strong focusing power of absorption concentration.
 This, however, does not detract from the fact that the development of concentration fulfils an important role in the context of insight meditation, a topic I will discuss in more detail in Chapter IV.^pg80
relevance of	^yd(THE RELEVANCE OF CONCENTRATION)
This chapter is devoted to the expression “free from desires and discontent in regard to the world” and its implications.
 Since the freedom from desires and discontent envisaged in this final part of the “definition” points to the development of mental composure when practising satipaṭṭhāna,
 in this chapter I investigate the role of concentration in the context of insight meditation, and try to ascertain the degree of concentration needed for realization.
 Thereafter I examine the general contribution of concentration to the development of insight and their interrelatedness.
freedom	^yd1(FREEDOM FROM DESIRES AND DISCONTENT)
The “definition” part of the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta concludes with the expression “free from desires and discontent in regard to the world”.^i1
 According to the Nettippakaraṇa, to be “free from desires and discontent” represents the faculty of concentration.^i2
 This suggestion finds support in some discourses, which slightly vary the “definition”, replacing “free from desires and discontent” with references to a concentrated mind or to experiencing happiness.^i3
 These passages ^pg81 indicate that freedom from desires and discontent represents mental calm and contentment.
	The commentaries go further and identify this part of the “definition” with the removal of the five hindrances.^i4
 This is sometimes understood to imply that the five hindrances have to be removed prior to embarking on satipaṭṭhāna contemplation.^i5
 Therefore this expression requires a detailed examination in order to see how far such a stipulation is justified.
	The Pāli term rendered “free” is vineyya, from the verb vineti (to remove).
 Although vineyya is best translated as “having removed”, this does not necessarily imply that desires and discontent must be removed before undertaking the practice of satipaṭṭhāna; it can also mean that this activity takes place simultaneously with the practice.^i6^pg82
	This way of understanding concurs with the general picture provided in the discourses.
 In a passage from the Aṅguttara Nikāya, for example, the practice of satipaṭṭhāna does not require, but rather results in, overcoming the hindrances.^i7
 Similarly, according to a discourse in the Satipaṭṭhāna Saṃyutta, lack of skill in the practice of satipaṭṭhāna prevents the practitioner from developing concentration and overcoming mental defilements.^i8
 This statement would be meaningless if the development of concentration and the absence of mental defilements were prerequisites for the practice ofsatipaṭṭhāna.
	Desires (abhijjhā) and discontent (domanassa), the two mental qualities whose removal is stipulated in the “definition”, occur again in relation to the last four steps in the sixteen-step scheme for mindfulness of breathing described in the Ānāpānasati Sutta.
 According to the Buddha’s explanation, by this stage of practice freedom from desires and discontent has been achieved.^i9
 This explanation suggests that the same was not yet the case for the previous twelve steps, which the Buddha nevertheless described as corresponding to the first three satipaṭṭhānas.^i10
 The disappearance of discontent on its own occurs also in the “direct path” passage of the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, where its removal is a goal of satipaṭṭhāna practice.^i11
 All these passages clearly demonstrate that a complete “removal” of desires and discontent is not a prerequisite for satipaṭṭhāna, but comes about as a result of successful practice.^i12
	The mental qualities to be removed are desires (abhijjhā) and discontent (domanassa).
 The commentaries identify these with the entire set of the five hindrances.^i13
 As a matter of fact, in several^pg83 discourses “desires” (abhijjhā) do replace the more usual sensual desire (kāmacchanda) as the first of the hindrances.^i14
 It is difficult to understand, however, why discontent (domanassa) should correspond to the hindrance of aversion (byāpāda).
 In the discourses, discontent (domanassa) stands for any kind of mental dejection, which would not necessarily be related to aversion, and certainly not be synonymous with it.^i15
 Besides, even if one were to accept the questionable equating of discontent with aversion, one would still have to account for the remaining three hindrances.^i16
	If it really were essential to remove the five hindrances before undertaking the practice of satipaṭṭhāna, several of the meditation practices described in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta would be rendered superfluous.
 These are the contemplation of unwholesome feelings and of unwholesome states of mind (worldly feelings, mind affected by lust or anger), and in particular awareness of the presence of just these five hindrances as the first contemplation of dhammas.
 These satipaṭṭhāna instructions clearly suggest that unwholesome states of mind, whether they be desires, discontent, or any of the hindrances, need not prevent one from practising satipaṭṭhāna, since they can profitably be turned into objects of mindful contemplation.
	In the light of these considerations, it seems quite probable that the Buddha did not envisage the removal of the five hindrances as a necessary precondition for the practice of satipaṭṭhāna.
 In fact, if he intended to stipulate their removal as a requirement for undertaking satipaṭṭhāna, one might wonder why he did not explicitly mention the hindrances, as he invariably did when describing the development of absorption (jhāna).^pg84
	The two mental qualities of desires and discontent, which the Buddha did mention in the satipaṭṭhāna “definition”, often occur in the discourses in relation to sense-restraint, a stage in the gradual path scheme prior to formal meditation.^i17
 At this stage, the meditator guards the sense doors in order to prevent sense impressions from leading to desires and discontent.
 Judging from these contexts, the expression “desires and discontent” refers in a general way to “likes” and “dislikes” in regard to what has been perceived.
	According to the presentation in the Ānāpānasati Sutta, the absence of such desires and discontent constitutes an important factor in carrying out the comparatively subtle and sophisticated meditations listed for contemplation of dhammas.
 This relates the absence of desires and discontent to an advanced stage of satipaṭṭhāna.
 Thus, vineyya as the completed action of “having removed” desires and discontent represents more advanced levels of satipaṭṭhāna.
 The discourses often refer to such advanced stages of satipaṭṭhāna contemplation as “well-established” (supatiṭṭhita).^i18
 At these more advanced stages of satipaṭṭhāna, impartial awareness is so firmly established (supatiṭṭhita) that one is effortlessly able to maintain dispassionate observation, without reacting with desires and discontent.
	Conversely, vineyya as a simultaneous action, as the act of “removing” taking place in the present, indicates a purpose of the initial stages of satipaṭṭhāna practice.
 During these initial stages the task is to build up a degree of inner equipoise within which desires and discontent are held at bay.
 These initial stages of satipaṭṭhāna parallel sense-restraint, which combines bare sati with deliberate effort in order to avoid or counterbalance desires and discontent.
 Although sense-restraint precedes proper meditation practice in the gradual path scheme, this does not imply that sense-restraint is completed at an exact point in time, only after which one moves on to formal practice.^i19
 In actual practice the two overlap to a considerable degree, so^pg85 that sense-restraint can be considered part of satipaṭṭhāna practice, particularly at those stages when desires and discontent have not yet been completely removed.
	Although the initial stages of satipaṭṭhāna practice may not require the prior establishment of a high level of concentration, or the complete removal of unwholesome states of mind, these are necessary for the advanced stages of the practice that are to lead up to realization.
 This necessity will occupy me during most of the remainder of this chapter, in which I will investigate in more detail the relationship of concentration to the progress towards realization.
 As a preparation for this investigation, I will first attempt to clarify the implications of the relevant terms: concentration (samādhi), right concentration (sammā samādhi), and absorption (jhāna).
absortion	^yd2(CONCENTRATION, RIGHT CONCENTRATION, AND ABSORPTION)
The noun samādhi is related to the verb samādahati, “to put together” r “to collect”, such as when one collects wood to kindle a fire.^i20
 Samādhi thus stands for “collecting” oneself, in the sense of composure or unification of the mind.^i21
	The discourses use the term “concentration” (samādhi) in a surprisingly broad manner, relating it to walking meditation, for example, or to observing the arising and passing away of feelings and cognitions, or to contemplating the arising and passing away of the five aggregates.^i22
 In a passage from the Aṅguttara Nikāya, even the four satipaṭṭhānas are treated as a form of concentration.^i23
 These occurrences demonstrate that, as used in the discourses, the term “concentration” (samādhi) is not restricted to the development of^pg86 calm (samatha) only, but can also refer to the realm of insight meditation (vipassanā).
	Turning to “right concentration” (sammā samādhi), here one finds time and again that the discourses equate right concentration with the four absorptions (jhānas).^i24
 This is of considerable importance, since “right” concentration is a prerequisite for awakening.
 Taking this definition literally, the development of “right” concentration requires the ability to attain all four absorptions.
 However, several discourses allow for full awakening based “only” on the ability to attain the first absorption.^i25
 This suggests that even the first absorption may be sufficient, in terms of concentrative ability, to enable the breakthrough to full awakening.^i26
	Interestingly, in the Mahācattārīsaka Sutta and several other discourses another definition of right concentration can be found that does not mention the absorptions at all.^i27
 The importance of the Mahācattārīsaka Sutta to the present discussion is further highlighted in the preamble to this discourse, which states the topic to be a teaching on right concentration.^i28
 The definition of right concentration given here speaks of unification of the mind (cittassekaggatā) in interdependence with the other seven path factors.^i29
 That is, in order for unification of the mind to become “right” concentration it needs to be contextualized within the noble eightfold path scheme.^i30
Definitions of right concentration that do not mention absorption^pg87 attainment can also be found in the Abhidhamma and the commentaries.^i31
	Thus the decisive factor that qualifies concentration as “right” is not just a question of the depth of concentration achieved, but is concerned with the purpose for which concentration is employed.
In particular, the presence of the path factor right view is indispensable.^i32
 By way of contrast, the Buddha’s former teachers, Āḷāra Kālāma and Uddaka Rāmaputta, despite their deep concentration attainments, were not endowed with “right” concentration because of the absence of right view.^i33
 This goes to show that the ability to attain absorption in itself does not yet constitute the fulfilment of the path factor of right concentration.
	A similar nuance underlies the qualification sammā, “right”, which literally means “togetherness”, or “to be connected in one”.^i34
 Thus to speak of the four absorptions or of unification of the mind as “right” oncentration does not simply mean that these are “right” and all else is “wrong”,
 but points to the need to incorporate the development of concentration into the noble eightfold path.
	Such a stipulation is not without practical relevance, since although the experience of absorption is a powerful tool to diminish^pg88 craving and attachment in regard to the five senses,
 it all too easily lends itself to stimulating craving for and attachment to these sublime “mind door” experiences.
 But only concentration untainted by craving can act as a full-fledged path factor of the noble eightfold path leading to the eradication of dukkha.
 It is this quality, and not just the depth of concentration achieved, that turns a concentrative attainment into right concentration.
	To sum up: to speak of “right” concentration is not simply a question of being able to attain absorption,
 since the decisive criterion for describing concentration as “right” is whether it is developed in conjunction with the other factors of the noble eightfold path.
	The word jhāna (absorption) is derived from the verb jhāyati “to meditate”.^i35
 Although jhāna usually refers to the attainment of deep absorption, the word occasionally retains its original meaning of meditation.
 The Gopakamoggallāna Sutta, for example, mentions a form of jhāna in which the hindrances still obsess the mind.^i36
 Such “jhāna” does not qualify as a meditative absorption, since it is the absence of the hindrances that characterizes true absorption.
	In order to assess the practical implications of such a true state of absorption, a brief examination of the first absorption is required at this point.
 The problem with understanding the first absorption is that two of its mental factors, initial mental application (vitakka) and sustained mental application (vicāra),^i37 have been differently interpreted.
 As vitakka, initial mental application, is etymologically related to takka, which denotes thought and logical reasoning, several scholars conclude that conceptual thought continues in the first^pg89 stage of absorption.^i38
 Some discourses appear at first sight to support this, since they refer to the second absorption as the “cessation of wholesome intentions”, or as a state of “noble silence”.^i39
	This point is of considerable relevance to an understanding of the nature of absorption.
 The issue at stake, simply stated, is whether the first absorption is a deep state of concentration, achieved only after a prolonged period of practice and seclusion, or a stage of relaxed happy reflection within easy reach of anyone and without much need for meditative proficiency.
	The latter assumption stands in contradiction to the commentarial presentation, which describes in detail the stages of development prior to absorption.^i40
 These sources indicate that to attain the first absorption a considerable amount of meditative development is required.
 Although references to this preliminary development appear only obliquely in the discourses, in one instance at least, the Upakkilesa Sutta, the Buddha gave a detailed account of his own struggle to attain the first absorption.^i41
 This passage leaves no doubt that the Buddha himself encountered considerable difficulty when he attempted to attain the first absorption, even though in his early youth he had already once experienced it.^i42^pg90
	The Upakkilesa Sutta is addressed to Anuruddha and a group of monks who were evidently in similar difficulties.
 On another occasion the Buddha also had to assist Moggallāna to attain the first absorption.^i43
 It is noteworthy that Anuruddha and Moggallāna, who both later excelled all other disciples with their concentrative powers,^i44 needed the Buddha’s personal intervention to attain “merely” he first absorption.
 These examples suggest that the attainment of the first absorption requires a considerable degree of meditative proficiency.
	According to the discourses, one who has entered the first absorption is no longer able to speak.^i45
 This would not apply if the first absorption were merely a state of calm mental reflection.
 Not only speech, but also hearing does not occur during the deeper stages of absorption; in fact, sound is a major obstacle to attaining the first absorption.^i46
 The experience of the first absorption is an “unworldly” experience;^i47 it constitutes another world in the psychological and the cosmological sense.^i48
 To attain the first absorption is to reach a ^pg91 “superbly extraordinary state”.^i49
 Already the first absorption “blindfolds” Māra, since on entering this state one goes beyond the range of Māra’s vision.^i50
	These passages support an understanding of the first absorption as a deeply absorbed state of mind, beyond mere reflection and conceptual thought.
 It is therefore reasonable to suppose that, as absorption-factors, initial mental application (vitakka) and sustained mental application (vicāra) do not imply full-fledged thinking activity.
 Rather, they refer to the initial and sustained application of attention.
 Such application of attention can also take place in the domain of thought or verbal communication, when initial mental application directs the mind towards what is to be thought or said, while sustained mental application maintains the coherence of a particular sequence of thoughts or words.
 In the context of absorption, however, this same activity is nothing more than an intentional deployment of attention, directed towards the object of concentration.
	To translate vitakka as “initial mental application” finds support in the Mahācattārīsaka Sutta, which includes “application of the mind” (cetaso abhiniropanā) in a list of synonyms for “right thought” along with vitakka.^i51 
 To understand vitakka as initial application of the mind can moreover claim support from the Abhidhamma and the commentaries, and from numerous modern meditation teachers and scholars.^i52
	This way of understanding can also be applied to the passages mentioned above, which at first sight seemed to suggest that conceptual thought continues in the first stage of absorption, since they spoke of the “cessation of wholesome intentions” on attaining the second absorption, a state of “noble silence”.
 Although initial mental application as a factor of the first absorption is different from discursive thought, initial mental application is nonetheless in this context a kind of “intention” and thereby involves a very subtle degree of deliberate mental activity.
 Only on entering the second absorption, when this last vestige of mental activity is abandoned and concentration ^pg92  has become fully stable,^i53 does the mind reach a state of complete inner stillness (“noble silence”), leaving behind even these subtle “wholesome intentions”.
	Based on the passages considered so far, it seems reasonable to suppose that “absorption” (jhāna) refers to profound experiences of deep concentration achieved after having developed a considerable degree of meditative proficiency.
and realization	^yd3(ABSORPTION AND REALIZATION)
Countless discourses recommend the development of concentration as an essential factor for “knowing things as they really are”.^i54
 Concentration is a requirement for full awakening,^i55 and this concentration has to be “right” concentration.^i56
 These specifications recommend absorption concentration as a requisite for full awakening.
 However, the question might be asked if the same is also required for stream-entry.
 Although, owing to the powerful impact of experiencing Nibbāna at stream-entry, the concentrative unification of one’s mind (cittassekaggatā) will momentarily reach a level comparable to absorption, how far does this require the previous development of absorption with a calmness object of meditation?^i57
	The qualities listed in the discourses as essential for the realization of stream-entry do not stipulate the ability to attain absorption.^i58
 Nor are such abilities mentioned in the descriptions of the qualities^pg93 that are characteristic of a stream-enterer subsequent to realization.^i59
	According to the discourses, what is a necessary condition for being able to gain stream-entry is a state of mind completely free from the five hindrances.^i60
 Although a convenient way to remove the hindrances is the development of absorption, this is not the only way to do so.
 According to a discourse in the Itivuttaka, the hindrances can also be removed and the mind become concentrated even during walking meditation, a posture not suitable for attaining absorption.^i61
 In fact, another passage shows that the hindrances can be temporarily absent even outside the context of formal meditation, such as when one is listening to the Dhamma.^i62
	This alternative is corroborated by a fair number of the attainments of stream-entry recorded in the discourses where the person in question might not even have meditated regularly in this life, much less be able to attain absorption.^i63
 Yet these reports invariably^pg94 mention the removal of the hindrances previous to the arising of insight.^i64
 In all these instances, the hindrances were removed as a result of attentively listening to the gradual instructions given by the Buddha.
	In fact, a substantial number of well-known modern meditation teachers base their teachings on the dispensability of absorption abilities for the realization of stream-entry.^i65
 According to them, for the mind to become momentarily “absorbed” in the experience of Nibbāna at stream-entry, the ability to attain mundane absorption is not a necessary requirement.
	The issue at question becomes even clearer when the next stage of awakening is considered, that of once-returning.
 Once-returners are so called because they will be reborn only once again in “this world” (i.e. the kāmaloka).^i66
 On the other hand, those who have developed the ability to attain absorption at will, and have not lost this ability, are not going to return to “this world” in their next life.^i67
 They will be reborn in a higher heavenly sphere (i.e. the rūpaloka or the arūpaloka).
 This certainly does not imply that a stream-enterer or a once-returner cannot have absorption attainments.
 But if they were all absorption attainers, the very concept of a “once-returner” ould be superfluous, since not a single once-returner would ever return to “this world”.
	According to the discourses, the difference between the realizations of “once-returning” and “non-returning” is related to differing^pg95 levels of concentrative ability.
 Several passages point out that the once-returner, in contrast to the non-returner, has not yet fulfilled the development of concentration.^i68
 Judging from this, the attainment of absorption might be of relevance for the realization of non-returning.
 In fact, several discourses relate progress towards the higher two stages of the path, non-returning and arahantship, to having had the experience of the first or higher absorptions.^i69
 The reason for this could be that the insightful contemplation of meditative absorption fulfils an important role in overcoming and completely eradicating the last traces of desire, and thereby facilitates the breakthrough to non-returning or full awakening.^i70
	The concluding passage of the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, the “prediction”, appears at first sight to contradict this, since it predicts the realization of full awakening or non-returning for successful satipaṭṭhāna practice without making any additional stipulations.^i71
 This could be taken to imply that absorption abilities can be dispensed with even for the higher stages of awakening.
 However, such assumptions need to be weighed against other evidence in the discourses, where the need for at least the first absorption is clearly and explicitly stated.^i72
 Although absorption abilities are not directly mentioned in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, the general picture provided by the discourses suggests that the ability to attain at least the first absorption is required for the higher two stages of awakening.
 Otherwise it would be difficult to understand why the Buddha mentioned absorption in the standard expositions of the noble eightfold path leading to full awakening.^pg96
	When considering the concluding passage of the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, one needs to take into account that this passage is concerned with the fruits of the practice, not with the need for a particular level of concentration as a prerequisite for realization.
 The fact that it mentions only the higher two fruits of realization highlights the potential of proper practice.
 The same holds true for a group of twenty discourses in the Bojjhaṅga Saṃyutta, which relate a broad range of meditation practices to these two higher realizations.^i73
 These instances, too, do not bear any relation to the presence or absence of absorption abilities, but rather call attention to the potential of the respective meditation practices.
 Moreover, the Madhyama Āgama and the Ekottara Āgama both mention absorption attainment as part of their expositions on satipaṭṭhāna.^i74
 This suggests that for satipaṭṭhāna to unfold its full potential of leading to non-returning or full awakening, the development of absorption is required.
	Another term relevant to the present topic is “purification of mind” (cittavisuddhi).
 This expression occurs in the Rathavinīta Sutta, which enumerates a series of seven successive stages of purification.^i75
 The discourse compares each stage of purification to a single chariot in a relay of chariots connecting two locations.
 In this sequence, purification of mind occupies the second position between the preceding purification of ethical conduct and the^pg97 subsequent purification of view.
 The fact that purification of mind precedes purification of view is sometimes taken to imply that absorption is a necessary basis for realization.^i76
	In this discourse, however, the question leading to the chariot simile was not at all concerned with the conditions necessary for realization.
 Rather, the topic discussed in the Rathavinīta Sutta was the aim of living the life of a monk or nun in the early Buddhist monastic community.
 The point was that each purification, though a necessary step on the path, falls short of the final goal.
 To illustrate this, the chariot simile was introduced.
 The need to move beyond different stages of purification in order to reach the final goal is in fact a recurrent theme in the discourses.^i77
	Although the chariot simile in the Rathavinīta Sutta does imply a conditional relationship between the various stages mentioned, to take this as stipulating that absorption must be attained before turning to the development of insight pushes this simile too far.
 Such a literal interpretation needs to regard the establishment of ethical conduct, concentration, and wisdom as a matter of strict linear sequence, whereas in practical reality these three have a symbiotic character, each enhancing and supporting the other.
 This is illustrated in the Soṇadaṇḍa Sutta, which compares the mutual interrelatedness of ethical conduct and wisdom to two hands washing each other.^i78
	Besides, according to two discourses in the Aṅguttara Nikāya it is impossible to purify concentration (viz. purification of the mind) without having first purified right view (viz. purification of view).^i79
This statement proposes exactly the reverse sequence to the Rathavinīta Sutta, where purification of the mind preceded purification of view.
	On further perusing the discourses one finds that they depict a variety of approaches to final realization.
 Two passages in the Aṅguttara Nikāya, for example, describe a practitioner who is able to gain deep wisdom, though lacking proficiency in concentration.^i80^pg98
 Another discourse in the same Nikāya speaks of two alternative approaches to full realization: the pleasant approach by way of absorption, and the much less pleasant approach by way of contemplating the repulsiveness of the body.^i81
 In addition, the Yuganaddha Sutta (in the same Aṅguttara Nikāya) states that realization can be gained by developing either concentration or insight first and then developing the other, or both can be developed together.^i82
 This discourse clearly shows that although some practitioners will build up concentration first and then turn to insight, others can follow the reverse procedure.
 It would do little justice to these passages if one were to limit the approach to realization to only one of these sequences, presuming that the development of concentration invariably has to precede the development of insight.
contribution	^yd4(THE CONTRIBUTION OF ABSORPTION TO THE PROGRESS OF INSIGHT)
Nevertheless, in many discourses the Buddha pointed out that the cultivation of absorption is particularly conducive to realization.^i83
 The development of deep concentration leads to a high degree of mastery over the mind.^i84
 Not only does absorption attainment entail the temporary removal of the hindrances, it also makes it much more difficult for them to invade the mind on later occasions.^i85
 On emerging from deep concentration the mind is “malleable”, “workable”, and “steady”,^i86 so that one can easily direct it to seeing things “as they truly are”.
 Not only that; when things are seen as they truly^pg99 are by a calm and malleable mind, this vision affects the deeper layers of the mind.
 Such a vision goes far beyond a superficial intellectual appreciation, because, owing to the receptivity and malleability of the mind, insights will be able to penetrate into the deeper regions of the mind and thereby bring about inner change.
	The advantages of developing absorption concentration are not only that it provides a stable and receptive state of mind for the practice of insight meditation.
 The experience of absorption is one of intense pleasure and happiness, brought about by purely mental means, which thereby automatically eclipses any pleasure arising in dependence on material objects.
 Thus absorption functions as a powerful antidote to sensual desires by divesting them of their former attraction.^i87
 In fact, according to the Cūḷadukkhakkhandha Sutta wisdom alone does not suffice to overcome sensuality, but needs the powerful support available through the experience of absorption.^i88
 The Buddha himself, during his own quest for awakening, overcame the obstruction caused by sensual desires only by developing absorption.^i89^pg100
	Deep concentration promotes inner stability and integration.^i90
 In this way, the experience of deep concentration fulfils an important role in fortifying the ability to withstand the destabilizing effect of those experiences that might be encountered during advanced stages of insight meditation.^i91
 Without a calm and integrated mind, able to withstand the impact of such experiences, a practitioner might lose the balanced stance of observation and become overwhelmed by fear, anxiety, or depression.
 The development of mental calm thus builds up a healthy degree of self-integration as a supportive basis for the development of insight.^i92
	Clearly, there are substantial advantages to be gained when the development of insight is supported and counterbalanced by the development of samatha.
 The experience of higher forms of happiness and the concomitant degree of personal integration are benefits that show that the development of samatha makes its own substantial contribution to progress along the path.
 This importance is expressed vividly in the discourses with the statement that one who has respect for the Buddha and his teaching will automatically hold concentration in high regard.^i93
 On the other hand, one who looks down on the development of concentration thereby only approves of those who have an unsteady mind.^i94
	Nevertheless, it needs to be said that the Buddha was also keenly aware of potential shortcomings of deep states of concentration.
 The attainment of absorption can turn into an obstacle on the path to ^pg101 realization if such attainment becomes a cause for pride or an object of attachment.
 The satisfaction and pleasure experienced during absorption, though facilitating the relinquishment of worldly pleasures, can make it more difficult to arouse the dissatisfaction and disenchantment required for the complete relinquishment of everything that leads up to realization.^i95
	The Māra Saṃyutta even reports a casualty of concentration meditation: a monk committed suicide because he had several times failed to stabilize his concentrative attainment.^i96
 On another occasion, when a monk was mourning his loss of concentration owing to physical illness, the Buddha dryly commented that such a reaction is characteristic of those who consider concentration the essence of their life and practice.^i97
 He then instructed the monk to contemplate the impermanent nature of the five aggregates instead.
calm	^yd5(CALM AND INSIGHT)
The central point that emerges when considering the relationship between calm and insight is the need for balance.
 Since a concentrated mind supports the development of insight, and the presence of wisdom in turn facilitates the development of deeper levels of concentration, calm (samatha) and insight (vipassanā) are at their best when developed in skilful cooperation.^i98
	Considered from this perspective, the controversy over the necessity or dispensability of absorption abilities for gaining a particular^pg102 level of realization is to some extent based on a misleading premise.
 This controversy takes for granted that the whole purpose of calmness meditation is to gain the ability to enter absorption as a stepping-stone for the development of insight, a sort of preliminary duty that either needs or does not need to be fulfilled.
 The discourses offer a different perspective.
 Here calm and insight are two complementary aspects of mental development.
 The question of practising only insight meditation does not arise, since the important function of calmness meditation, as a practice in its own right, is never reduced to its auxiliary role in relation to insight meditation.
	This need for both calm and insight on the path to realization leads me on to another issue.
 Some scholars have understood these two aspects of meditation to represent two different paths, possibly even leading to two different goals.
 They assume that the path of samatha proceeds via the ascending series of absorptions to the attainment of the cessation of cognition and feeling (saññāvedayitanirodha) and thence to the cessation of passion.
 In contrast to this, the path of insight, at times mistakenly understood to be a process of pure intellectual reflection, supposedly leads to a qualitatively different goal, the cessation of ignorance.^i99
	A passage from the Aṅguttara Nikāya does indeed relate the practice of samatha to the destruction of passion and the practice of vipassanā to the destruction of ignorance.^i100
 The distinction between the two is expressed by the expressions “freedom of the mind” (cetovimutti) and “freedom by wisdom” (paññāvimutti) respectively.
 However, these two expressions are not simply equivalent in value relative to realization.
 While “freedom by wisdom” (paññāvimutti) refers to the realization of Nibbāna, “freedom of the mind” (cetovimutti),  unless further specified as “unshakeable” (akuppa), does not imply the same.
 “Freedom of the mind” can also connote temporary^pg103 experiences of mental freedom, such as the attainment of the fourth absorption, or the development of the divine abodes (brahmavihāra).^i101
 Thus this passage is presenting not two different approaches to realization but two aspects of the meditative path, one of which is not sufficient by itself to bring realization.^i102
	Another relevant discourse is the Susīma Sutta, which reports various monks declaring realization.^i103
 Since these monks at the same time denied having attained supernatural powers, this passage has sometimes been understood to imply that full awakening can be attained merely by intellectual reflection.^i104
 In reality, however, the monks’ declaration that they were only “freed by wisdom” indicates that they were not in possession of the immaterial meditative attainments.
 It does not mean that they gained realization without meditating at all, by a purely intellectual approach.^i105
	A similar problem is sometimes seen in regard to the Kosambi Sutta, where a monk declared that he had personal realization of dependent co-arising (paṭicca samuppāda), although he was not an arahant. ^i106
 This passage becomes intelligible if one follows the commentarial explanation, according to which the monk in question was “only” a once-returner.^i107
 The point here is that personal realization of the principle of dependent co-arising is not a ^pg104 characteristic of full awakening only, but is already a feature of streamentry.
	Instead of perceiving these passages as expressing an “underlying tension” between two different paths to realization, they simply describe different aspects of what is basically one approach.^i108
 As a matter of fact, full awakening requires a purification of both the cognitive and the affective aspect of the mind.
 Although on theoretical examination these two aspects of the path might appear different, in actual practice they tend to converge and supplement each other.
	This is neatly summarized in the Paṭisambhidāmagga, which emphasizes the importance of appreciating the essential similarity between calm and insight meditation in terms of their function.^i109
 A practitioner might develop one or the other aspect to a higher degree at different times, but in the final stages of practice both calm and insight need to be combined in order to reach the final aim – full awakening – the destruction of both passion and ignorance.^pg105
refrain	^ye(THE SATIPAṬṬHĀNA “REFRAIN”)
Having examined the “definition” of the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta at some length, I shall now look at a part of the discourse which could be called the “modus operandi” of satipaṭṭhāna. ^i1
 This part, which I refer to as the “refrain”, occurs after each of the meditation exercises described in the discourse and presents four key aspects of satipaṭṭhāna (cf. Fig. 5.1 below).^i2
 The task of this “refrain” is to direct attention to those aspects that are essential for the proper practice of each exercise.
 Thus an understanding of the implications of the “refrain” orms a necessary background to the meditation techniques described in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, which I will begin to examine in Chapter VI.
 In the case of the first satipaṭṭhāna, the “refrain” reads:
	^sutta In this way, in regard to the body he abides contemplating the body internally, or he abides contemplating the body externally, or he abides contemplating the body both internally and externally.
Or, he abides contemplating the nature of arising in the body, or he abides contemplating the nature of passing away in the body, or he abides contemplating the nature of both arising and passing away in the body.
Or, mindfulness that “there is a body” is established in him to the extent necessary for bare knowledge and continuous mindfulness.
And he abides independent, not clinging to anything in the world.^i3^pg106
fig5.1	internal/external(ajjhatta/bahiddhā)
arising/passing away(samudaya/vaya)
bare knowledge + continuous mindfulness(ñāṇamattāya paṭissatimattāya)
independent, without clinging(anissito ca viharati, na ca kiñci loke upādiyati)
^fig5.1(Key aspects of the satipaṭṭhāna refrain)
	The “refrain” indicates that the scope of satipaṭṭhāna practice includes internal and external phenomena, and that it is in particular their nature to arise and pass away which should be given attention.
 By including both internal and external phenomena, the “refrain” roadens the contemplative perspective.
 By mentioning contemplation of their impermanent nature, the “refrain” moreover directs awareness to the temporal axis of experience, that is, to the passage of time.
 Thus, with these instructions, the “refrain” expands the scope of each satipaṭṭhāna exercise along its spatial and temporal axes.
 As the discourses explicitly point out, these two aspects are required for a proper undertaking of satipaṭṭhāna. ^i4
 The “refrain” also describes the proper attitude to be adopted during contemplation:
 observation should be undertaken merely for the purpose of establishing awareness and understanding, and should remain free from clinging.
	With the “refrain”, the practice of satipaṭṭhāna turns towards the general characteristics of the contemplated phenomena.^i5
At this stage of practice, awareness of the specific content of experience gives way to an understanding of the general nature and character of the satipaṭṭhāna under contemplation.
	This shift of awareness from the individual content of a particular experience to its general features is of central importance for the ^pg107 development of insight.^i6
 Here the task of sati is to penetrate beyond the surface appearance of the object under observation and to lay bare the characteristics it shares with all conditioned phenomena.
 This move of sati towards the more general characteristics of experience brings about insight into the impermanent, unsatisfactory, and selfless nature of reality.
 Such a more panoramic kind of awareness emerges at an advanced stage of satipaṭṭhāna, once the meditator is able to maintain awareness effortlessly.
 At this stage, when sati has become well-established, whatever occurs at any sense door automatically becomes part of the contemplation.^i7
	It is noteworthy that two of the most popular contemporary vipassanā schools of the Theravāda tradition both recognize the importance of developing such bare awareness of whatever arises at any sense door as an advanced stage of insight meditation.
 To judge from writings of Mahasi Sayadaw and U Ba Khin, their particular meditation techniques are apparently mainly expedient means for beginners, who are not yet able to practise such bare awareness at all sense doors.^i8
internal	^ye1(INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL CONTEMPLATION)
The two expressions used in the first part of the “refrain” are “internal” (ajjhatta) and its complementary opposite “external” (bahiddhā).
 The significance of these two terms is not further explained in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta.
 The Abhidhamma and the commentaries associate internal with the personal and external with corresponding ^pg108 phenomena in other human beings.^i9
 Modern meditation teachers have proposed several alternative interpretations.
 In order to explore the possible implications of internal and external satipaṭṭhāna comprehensively, I will at first consider the Abhidhammic and commentarial interpretation.
 Then I will survey some alternative interpretations.
	According to the Abhidhamma and the commentarial interpretation, “internal” and “external” satipaṭṭhāna encompasses phenomena arising in oneself and in others.
 In this way, proper practice of satipaṭṭhāna would also include awareness of the subjective experience of others.
 Although this may be quite feasible in the case of observing another person’s body, to directly experience another’s feelings or states of mind seems at first sight to require psychic powers.^i10
 This would, of course, significantly limit the possibility of carrying out “external” satipaṭṭhāna.
	Yet in the Satipaṭṭhāna Saṃyutta the Buddha introduced these three modes of attention – internal, external, and both – separately as a “threefold way of developing satipaṭṭhāna”.^i11
 This passage certifies that each of the three constitutes a relevant aspect of satipaṭṭhāna practice.
 The same can be inferred from the fact that the Vibhaṅga, a^pg109 comparatively early part of the Pāli Abhidhamma, shifts the distinction between internal and external from the “refrain” to the “definition” part of the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta,^i12 thereby incorporating internal and external contemplation into what constitutes “right” mindfulness.
 Both this Abhidhammic modification and the above-quoted discourse point to the importance of applying sati both internally and externally.
 In fact, the Vibhaṅga makes a special point of stating that an external application of sati, just as much as an internal application, can lead to realization.^i13
 Similarly, a discourse in the Bojjhaṅga Saṃyutta points out that both internal and external sati can act as an awakening factor.^i14
	In order to do justice to this evident importance, a practicable solution is possibly to develop awareness of another’s feelings and mental condition by carefully observing their outer manifestations.
 Feelings and states of mind do affect the outer appearance of a person by influencing their facial expression, tone of voice, and physical posture.^i15
	This suggestion finds support in several discourses that list four means of knowing another person’s state of mind: based on what one sees, based on what one hears, by considering and further reflecting on what one has heard, and lastly with the help of mind reading.^i16
 Apart from mind reading, these means do not require^pg110 psychic powers, only awareness and some degree of common sense.
 Understood in this way, an “external” application of awareness in relation to the various practices detailed in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta becomes a practicable possibility.
	Thus external satipaṭṭhāna could be undertaken by directing awareness towards another person’s posture, facial expression, and tone of voice, as indicators of their feelings or state of mind.
 Undertaking external awareness of another in this way would to some extent resemble the way a psychoanalyst observes a patient, closely examining behaviour and related symptoms in order to assess their state of mind.
 Thus an external application of awareness would be a practice particularly suitable in daily life, since most of the phenomena to be observed will probably not occur while one is seated in formal meditation.
	Such “external” contemplation of the behaviour and mental reactions of others can then lead to an increasingly deeper appreciation of the character traits of the person in question.
 Helpful information for such appreciation can be found in the commentaries, which offer descriptions of different human character-types and their corresponding behaviour patterns.^i17
 According to these descriptions, characteristic mental dispositions of anger or greed can be inferred by observing, for example, a particular monk’s eating habits and way of wearing his robes.
 Differences in character even show up in the different ways a simple task such as sweeping is performed.
	According to the instructions in the “refrain”, “internal” contemplation precedes its “external” counterpart.
 This indicates that the first step of internal contemplation serves as a basis for understanding similar phenomena in others during the second step, external contemplation.
 Indeed, to be aware of one’s own feelings and reactions enables one to understand the feelings and reactions of others more easily.^i18^pg111
	For a balanced development of awareness, this shift from the internal to the external is of considerable importance.
 Awareness applied only internally can lead to self-centredness.
 One can become excessively concerned with what happens with and within oneself while at the same time remaining unaware of how one’s action and behaviour affect others.
 Practising both internal and external satipaṭṭhāna can prevent such lopsidedness and achieve a skilful balance between introversion and extroversion.^i19
	The third step of this aspect in the “refrain” instructs the meditator to observe “both internally and externally”.
 The commentaries explain that, since one cannot contemplate an object both internally and externally simultaneously, the instruction implies that one should alternate between these two modes.^i20
 This commentarial presentation does not really add anything new to the previous two stages of practice, since to contemplate either internally or externally already entails alternating between these two modes.
 The Vibhaṅga offers a more convincing perspective, since its presentation of contemplating both internally and externally points to an understanding of the contemplated object as such, without considering it as part of one’s own subjective experience, or that of others.^i21
 Practised in this way, satipaṭṭhāna contemplation shifts towards an increasingly “objective” and detached stance, from which the observed phenomena are experienced as such, independent of whether they occur in oneself or in others.
	The Abhidhammic and commentarial interpretation of “internal” nd “external” as referring to oneself and others tallies with several other passages in the early discourses.
 In the Sāmagāma Sutta, for example, the same two terms are used when countering various unwholesome qualities and unskilful forms of behaviour, whether these occur in oneself (ajjhatta) or in others (bahiddhā).^i22
 And in the Janavasabha Sutta, in a context directly related to satipaṭṭhāna, “external” explicitly refers to the bodies, feelings, etc. of others.^i23
 This ^pg112 passage carries considerable weight in relation to the present discussion, since it is the only discourse to provide additional information on the nature of “external” satipaṭṭhāna.
alternative	^ye2(ALTERNATIVE INTERPRETATIONS OF INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL CONTEMPLATION)
Modern meditation teachers have proposed various alternative interpretations of internal and external satipaṭṭhāna.
 Some take “internal” and “external” to mean quite literally what is spatially internal and external.
 They suggest that external bodily feelings, for example, are those observed at skin level (bahiddhā), while internal bodily feelings are those occurring deeper within the body (ajjhatta).^i24
	“Internal” (ajjhatta) occurs in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta itself in a clearly spatial sense, referring to the six internal senses in contrast to their external objects.
 However, the Pāli term used in this context for the external sense objects is not bahiddhā, but bāhira. ^i25
 In contrast, “internal” (ajjhatta) and “external” (bahiddhā) as qualities mentioned in the “refrain” do not seem to convey such a spatial distinction.
 In the case of contemplating the sense-spheres, for example, such a spatial understanding of “internal” and “external” does not yield a meaningful way of practice,
 since according to the “refrain” the entire sense-sphere, consisting of internal sense and external object, has to be contemplated internally and then externally.
 The difficulty involved in taking “internal” and “external” to represent a spatial distinction extends to most of the satipaṭṭhāna contemplations.
 Neither states of mind nor such dhammas as the hindrances or the awakening factors fit easily into a distinction between spatially internal and external occurrences,
 unless one were to adopt the commentarial interpretation and take “external” to refer to states of mind, hindrances, or awakening factors occurring in other persons.
	Other teachers suggest that the distinction between internal and external contemplation hints at the difference between apparent and ultimate truth.^i26
 It is certainly true that as practice progresses ^pg113 one comes to see phenomena more and more in their true nature.
 Yet it is highly improbable that a distinction between apparent and ultimate truth corresponds to the original sense of “internal” and “external” in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta,
 firstly because neither of the two terms ever has this implication in the discourses, and secondly simply because the distinction between these two levels of truth is a late development, belonging to the post-canonical period.^i27
	Another interpretation proposes to distinguish between internal mental and external physical objects, so that in the case of feelings,
 for example, one distinguishes mental feelings (ajjhatta) from physical feelings (bahiddhā), and in the case of mind one distinguishes between purely mental experience (ajjhatta) and states of mind related to sensory experiences (bahiddhā).^i28
	This way of understanding “internal” and “external” can claim for support a passage in the Iddhipāda Saṃyutta, which relates internal contraction to sloth-and-torpor, while its externally distracted counterpart is sensual distraction by way of the five senses.^i29
 Another relevant passage occurs in the Bojjhaṅga Saṃyutta, which differentiates the hindrances sensual desire, aversion, and doubt into internal and external occurrences.^i30
 This passage could refer to the arising of ^pg114 these hindrances owing to mind door events (ajjhatta), or owing to a sense door input (bahiddhā).
	On the other hand, the qualification “internal” occurs in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta also as part of the main instruction for contemplating the hindrances and the awakening factors.
 This usage does not seem to be related to the distinction between experiences by way of the mind door and that of the five sense doors, but appears to emphasize the sense that a hindrance or an awakening factor is present “within me”, paralleling the commentarial understanding of “internal” as referring to oneself.^i31
	Elsewhere in the discourses, ajjhatta on its own does indeed denote what is internal in the sense of being a predominantly mental type of experience.
 A typical example of such usage is the second jhāna, which the standard descriptions qualify as a state of “internal” erenity.^i32
 Internal in the sense of “mental” occurs also in the Uddesavibhaṅga Sutta, which contrasts an “internally stuck” state of mind with consciousness being “externally distracted”.
 Yet in this discourse, “external”, which according to the above interpretation should stand only for the five physical senses, refers to all six senses.^i33
 Similarly, in other discourses “internal” stands not only for pure mind door events, but is at times related to all six senses.^i34
	These passages suggest that to understand “internal” and “external” as respective references to mind door and five sense door events is not always appropriate.
 The same holds true in relation to several of the satipaṭṭhāna contemplations.
 Among the six sense-spheres, for example, a distinction can easily be made between the mind door and the physical sense doors.
 Yet it is difficult to conceive of a meaningful contemplation that treats the entire set ^pg115 of six sense-spheres first internally, from a purely mental viewpoint, and then externally, from the perspective of the five sense doors.
	In summary, although alternative ways of understanding internal and external satipaṭṭhāna have their practical value,
 to understand “internal” as referring to oneself and “external” as referring to others offers a practicable form of contemplation which can moreover claim support from the discourses, the Abhidhamma, and the commentaries.
	In the end, whichever interpretation one may adopt, once contemplation is practised both internally and externally it entails a shift towards a comprehensive type of practice.^i35
 At this stage even the boundary between “I” and “other” or “internal” and “external” is left behind, leading to a comprehensive vision of phenomena as such, independent of any sense of ownership.
 Such a more wideranging view involves either a contemplation of oneself and others, or a contemplation of any internal phenomenon together with its external counterpart.
 Thus each of the ways of understanding “internal” and “external” discussed above ultimately leads to a more comprehensive appreciation of the phenomena under observation.^i36
 Based on such a comprehensive view of phenomena, satipaṭṭhāna practice then proceeds to the next aspect mentioned in the “refrain”: awareness of their impermanent nature.
impermanence	^ye3(IMPERMANENCE)
The “refrain” instructs the meditator to contemplate “the nature of arising”, “the nature of passing away”, and “the nature of both arising and passing away”.^i37
 Paralleling the instruction on internal and external contemplation, the three parts of this instruction represent a temporal progression which leads from observing the arising ^pg116 aspect of phenomena to focusing on their disappearance, and culminates in a comprehensive vision of impermanence as such.
	According to the discourses, not seeing the arising and passing away of phenomena is simply ignorance, while to regard all phenomena as impermanent leads to knowledge and understanding.^i38
 Insight into the impermanence of the five aggregates or of the six sense-spheres is “right view”, and thereby leads directly on to realization.^i39
 Thus the direct experience of impermanence represents indeed the “power” aspect of meditative wisdom.^i40
 These passages clearly show the central importance of developing a direct experience of the impermanent nature of all phenomena, as envisaged in this part of the satipaṭṭhāna “refrain”.
 The same is reflected in the commentarial scheme of the insight knowledges, which details key experiences to be encountered during the path to realization, where the stage of apprehending the arising and passing away of phenomena is of central importance.^i41
	The other two characteristics of conditioned existence – dukkha (unsatisfactoriness) and anattā (absence of a self) – become evident as a consequence of a direct experience and thereby realistic appreciation of the truth of impermanence.
 The discourses frequently point to this relationship between the three characteristics by presenting a progressive pattern that leads from awareness of impermanence (aniccasaññā) via acknowledging the unsatisfactory nature of what is impermanent (anicce dukkhasaññā) to appreciating the selfless nature of what is unsatisfactory (dukkhe anattasaññā).^i42
 The same pattern features prominently in the Anattalakkhaṇa Sutta, in which the Buddha instructed his first disciples to become clearly aware of the impermanent nature of each aspect of subjective ^pg117 experience, expounded in terms of the five aggregates.
 Based on this, he then led them to the conclusion that whatever is impermanent cannot yield lasting satisfaction and therefore does not qualify to be considered as “I”, “mine”, or “my self”.^i43
 This understanding, after being applied to all possible instances of each aggregate, was powerful enough to result in the full awakening of the first five monk disciples of the Buddha.
	The underlying pattern of the Buddha’s instruction in this discourse shows that insight into impermanence serves as an important foundation for realizing dukkha and anattā.
 The inner dynamic of this pattern proceeds from clear awareness of impermanence to a growing degree of disenchantment (which corresponds to dukkhasaññā),^i44 which in turn progressively reduces the “I”-making and “my”-making embedded in one’s mind (this being the equivalent to anattasaññā).^i45
	The importance of developing insight into the arising and passing away of phenomena is highlighted in the Vibhaṅga Sutta of the Saṃyutta Nikāya, according to which this insight marks the distinction between mere establishment of satipaṭṭhāna and its complete and full “development” (bhāvanā).^i46
 This passage underlines the importance of the “refrain” for a proper development of satipaṭṭhāna.
 Mere awareness of the various objects listed under the four satipaṭṭhānas might not suffice for the task of developing penetrative ^pg118 insight.
 What is additionally required is to move on to a comprehensive and equanimous vision of impermanence.^i47
	Direct experience of the fact that everything changes, if applied to all aspects of one’s personality, can powerfully alter the habit patterns of one’s mind.^i48
 This may well be why awareness of impermanence assumes a particularly prominent role in regard to the contemplation of the five aggregates where, in addition to being mentioned in the “refrain”, it has become part of the main instruction.^i49
	Continuity in developing awareness of impermanence is essential if it is really to affect one’s mental condition.^i50
 Sustained contemplation of impermanence leads to a shift in one’s normal way of experiencing reality, which hitherto tacitly assumed the temporal stability of the perceiver and the perceived objects.
 Once both are experienced as changing processes, all notions of stable existence and substantiality vanish, thereby radically reshaping one’s paradigm of experience.
	Contemplation of impermanence has to be comprehensive, for if any aspect of experience is still taken to be permanent, awakening will be impossible.^i51
 A comprehensive realization of impermanence is a distinctive feature of stream-entry.
 This is the case to such an extent that a stream-enterer is incapable of believing any phenomenon to be permanent.^i52
 Understanding of impermanence reaches perfection with the realization of full awakening.^i53
 For arahants, ^pg119 awareness of the impermanent nature of all sensory input is a natural feature of their experience.^i54
	Apart from encouraging awareness of impermanence, this part of the “refrain” can also, according to the commentarial view, be taken to refer to the factors (dhammas) that condition the arising and the disappearance of the observed phenomena.^i55
 These factors are treated in the Samudaya Sutta, which relates the “arising” and “disappearing” of each satipaṭṭhāna to its respective condition, these being nutriment in the case of body, contact for feelings, nameand-form for mind, and attention for dhammas. ^i56
	Within the framework of early Buddhist philosophy, both impermanence and conditionality are of outstanding importance.
 In the course of the Buddha’s own approach to awakening, recollection of his past lives and the sight of other beings passing away and being reborn vividly brought home to him the truths of impermanence and conditionality on a personal and universal scale.^i57
 The same two aspects contributed to the realization of the previous Buddha, Vipassī, when after a detailed examination of dependent co-arising (paṭicca samuppāda), satipaṭṭhāna contemplation of the impermanent nature of the five aggregates led to his awakening.^i58
 I will therefore consider this additional perspective on this part of the satipaṭṭhāna ^pg120  “refrain” by surveying the Buddha’s teaching on conditionality within its philosophical and historical context.
coarising	^ye4(DEPENDENT CO-ARISING (PAṬICCA SAMUPPĀDA）)
At the time of the Buddha, a variety of philosophical positions on causality were current in India.^i59
 Some teachings claimed that the universe was controlled by an external power, either an omnipotent god or a principle inherent in nature.
 Some took man to be the independent doer and enjoyer of action.
 Some favoured determinism, while others completely rejected any kind of causality.^i60
 Despite their differences, all these positions concurred in recognizing an absolute principle, formulated in terms of the existence (or absence) of a single or first cause.
	The Buddha, on the other hand, proposed dependent co-arising (paṭicca samuppāda) as his “middle way” explanation of causality.
 His conception of dependent co-arising was so decisive a departure from existing conceptions of causality that he came to reject all of the four prevalent ways of formulating causality.^i61
	The discourses often describe dependent co-arising (paṭicca samuppāda) with a model of twelve sequential links.
 This sequence traces the conditioned arising of dukkha back to ignorance (avijjā).
 According to the Paṭisambhidāmagga, these twelve links extend over three consecutive individual lifetimes.^i62
 The twelve links applied to three lifetimes probably assumed increasing importance in the historical development of Buddhist thought, as a way of explaining ^pg121 rebirth without an eternally surviving agent.^i63
 Although the sequence of twelve links occurs frequently in the discourses, substantial variants can also be found.
 Some of these start with the third link, consciousness, which moreover stands in a reciprocal relationship with the next link, name-and-form.^i64
 These and other variations suggest that the mode of explanation based on three lifetimes is not the only possible way of approaching an understanding of dependent co-arising.
	In fact, the twelve links are but a particularly frequent application of the general structural principle of dependent co-arising.^i65
 In the Paccaya Sutta of the Saṃyutta Nikāya, the Buddha introduced this important distinction between the general principle and its application.
 This discourse speaks of the twelve links as dependently originated phenomena, while “paṭicca samuppāda” refers to the relation between them, that is, to the principle.^i66
	This distinction between the principle and the twelve links as one of its applications is of considerable practical relevance, since a full understanding of causality is to be gained with stream-entry.^i67
 The distinction between principle and application suggests that such an ^pg122 understanding of causality need not necessarily require a personal experience of the twelve links.
 That is, even without developing the ability to recollect past lives and thereby directly experiencing those factors of the twelve links that supposedly pertain to a past life, one can still personally realize the principle of dependent co-arising.
	Compared to the entire set of twelve links, the basic principle of dependent co-arising is more easily amenable to direct contemplation.
 A discourse in the Nidāna Saṃyutta, for example, applies “dependent co-arising” to the conditioned relation between contact and feeling.^i68
 Such direct application of the principle to subjective experience occurs also in the Vibhaṅga, which relates dependent co-arising to single mind-moments.^i69
	Another example of a direct application of the principle of conditionality can be found in the Indriyabhāvanā Sutta, which qualifies pleasure and displeasure arising at any of the six sense doors as dependently arisen (paṭicca samuppanna), a usage that is not related to past or future lives.^i70
 The same holds true for the Madhupiṇḍika Sutta’s detailed analysis of the perceptual process.^i71
 This discourse depicts the “arising” (uppāda) of consciousness “in dependence”
(paṭicca) on sense organ and sense object, with contact being the coming “together” (saṃ) of the three.
 This passage reveals a deeper significance of each part of the term paṭicca sam-uppāda, “dependent” “co-” “arising”, without any need for different lifetimes or for the whole set of twelve links.
 Thus realization of dependent co-arising can take place simply by witnessing the operation of ^pg123 conditionality in the present moment, within one’s own subjective experience.
principle	^ye5(THE PRINCIPLE OF DEPENDENT CO-ARISING AND ITS PRACTICAL APPLICATION)
To speak of dependent co-arising is to speak of specific conditions related to specific events.
 Such “specific conditionality” (idappaccayatā) can be illustrated in the following manner:
When A is → B comes to be.
With the arising of A → B arises.
When A is not → B does not come to be.
With the cessation of A → B ceases.^i72
	The operation of dependent co-arising is not confined to a strictly linear sequence of events in time.
 Rather, dependent co-arising stands for the conditional interrelation of phenomena, constituting a web of interwoven events, where each event is related to other events by way of both cause and effect.^i73
 Each conditioning factor is at the same time itself conditioned, which thereby excludes the possibility of a transcendent, independent cause.^i74
	Within these interwoven patterns, the centrally important specific condition, from the viewpoint of subjective experience, is volition.
 It is the mental volition of the present moment that decisively influences future activities and events.^i75
 Volition itself is under the influence of other conditions such as one’s habits, character traits, and past experiences, which influence the way one experiences a ^pg124 particular situation.
 Nevertheless, inasmuch as each volition involves a decision between alternatives, one’s volitional decision in the present moment is to a considerable degree amenable to personal intervention and control.
 Each decision in turn shapes the habits, character traits, experiences, and perceptual mechanisms that form the context of future decisions.
 It is precisely for this reason that systematic training of the mind is imperative.
	In the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, a more specific application of conditionality to the practice of meditation becomes apparent during most of the contemplations of dhammas.
 Here one finds that the meditator’s task in relation to the five hindrances is to observe the conditions for their arising and removal.^i76
 Regarding the six sense-spheres, contemplation should disclose how the process of perception can cause the arising of mental fetters at the sense doors.^i77
 In the case of the awakening factors, the task is to recognize the conditions for their arising and further development.^i78
 Coming to the four noble truths, this last contemplation of dhammas is in itself a statement of conditionality, namely of the conditions for dukkha and its eradication.
 In this way, the principle of dependent co-arising underlies a range of applications in the fourth satipaṭṭhāna.^i79
	The development of a meditative realization of dependent coarising could be alluded to in the “direct path” passage of the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, since it lists the acquiring of “method” (ñāya) as one of the goals of satipaṭṭhāna.^i80
 The same term, “method”, occurs often in the discourses as a quality of those who have realized stream-entry or higher stages of awakening.^i81
 Several instances speak of “noble method” as an outcome of the realization of stream^pg125 entry.^i82
 In these contexts, “noble method” implies the realization of dependent co-arising.^i83
 The relevance of dependent co-arising for progress to realization is confirmed in several other passages, according to which one who knows dependent co-arising is standing at the threshold of the deathless.^i84
 Although the expression “method” is not further specified as noble in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, it does not seem too far-fetched to presume that its occurrence indicates a direct realization of the principle or “method” of dependent co-arising to be one of the purposes of satipaṭṭhāna practice.
mere awareness	^ye6(MERE AWARENESS AND CLINGING TO NOTHING)
As the “refrain” stipulates, awareness of the body, feelings, mind, and dhammas should take place merely for the sake of knowledge and continued mindfulness.^i85
 This instruction points to the need to observe objectively, without getting lost in associations and reactions.
 According to the commentaries, this refers in particular to avoiding any form of identification.^i86
 Freedom from identification then enables one to regard any aspect of one’s subjective experience^pg126 as a mere phenomenon, free from any type of self-image or attachment.
	The way this instruction is phrased suggests the use of mental labelling.
 Mindfulness is established that “there is body” (feelings, mind, dhammas).
 The Pāli particle iti used here indicates direct speech, which in the present context suggests a form of mental noting.
 This is in fact not the only instance of this kind of recommendation in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta.
 Most of the instructions in the discourse use direct speech to formulate what is to be known.^i87
	This way of presentation shows that concepts, especially when used as labelling tools for the purpose of mental noting, can be skilfully employed within the context of satipaṭṭhāna.^i88
 Thus the practice of satipaṭṭhāna does not require a complete relinquishment of all forms of verbal knowledge.^i89
 In fact, concepts are intrinsically related to cognition (saññā), since the ability to recognize and understand relies on a subtle level of mental verbalization and thereby on the use of concepts.
 The skilful use of labelling during satipaṭṭhāna contemplation can help to strengthen clear recognition and understanding.
 At the same time, labelling introduces a healthy degree of inner detachment, since the act of apostrophizing one’s moods and emotions diminishes one’s identification with them.
	According to the Buddha’s survey of wrong views in the Brahmajāla Sutta, misinterpretations of reality can often be based on meditative experiences, not only on theoretical speculation.^i90
 To prevent such misinterpretations, a firm acquaintance with the Dhamma is an important factor for proper progress along the meditative path.
 In one instance, the Buddha compared such sound knowledge of the ^pg127 Dhamma to the armoury of swords and spears used to defend a fortress.^i91
 Clearly, for the Buddha the mere absence of concepts does not constitute the final goal of meditation practice.^i92
 Concepts are not the problem, the problem is how concepts are used.
 An arahant still employs concepts, yet without being bound by them.^i93
	On the other hand, satipaṭṭhāna has to be clearly distinguished from mere intellectual reflection.
 What this part of the “refrain” indicates is the extent to which concepts and labels are appropriate within the context of insight meditation.
 This should be kept to an absolute minimum, only “to the extent necessary for bare knowledge and continuous mindfulness”.^i94
 Labelling is not an end in itself, only a means to an end.
 Once knowledge and awareness are well established, labelling can be dispensed with.
	The inability of a purely theoretical approach to result in awakening is a recurrent theme in the discourses.^i95
 To spend one’s time intellectually considering the Dhamma and thereby neglecting actual practice clearly meets with the Buddha’s disapproval.
 According to him, one who acts thus cannot be considered a practitioner of the Dhamma, but merely as someone caught up in thinking.^i96^pg128
	Sati as such is mere awareness of phenomena, without letting the mind stray into thoughts and associations.^i97
 According to the satipaṭṭhāna “definition”, sati operates in combination with clearly knowing (sampajāna).
 The same presence of knowledge also underlies the expression “he knows” (pajānāti), which occurs frequently in the individual satipaṭṭhāna contemplations.
 Thus to “know”, or to contemplate “clearly knowing”, can be taken to represent the conceptual input needed for taking clear cognizance of the observed phenomena, based on mindful observation.^i98
	This (re-)cognizing aspect inherent in the quality of clearly knowing or in the expression “he knows” can be further developed and strengthened through the practice of mental noting.
 It is this “knowing” quality of the mind that brings about understanding.
 Thus, while satipaṭṭhāna meditation takes place in a silently watchful state of mind, free from intellectualization, it can nevertheless make appropriate use of concepts to the extent needed to further knowledge and awareness.
	The fact that contemplation undertaken in this manner has the sole purpose of enhancing mindfulness and understanding points to an important shift away from goal-oriented practice.
 At this comparatively advanced stage, satipaṭṭhāna is practised for its own sake.
 With this shift in attitude, the goal and the act of meditation begin to merge into one, since awareness and understanding are cultivated for the sake of developing ever more awareness and understanding.
 The practice of satipaṭṭhāna becomes an “effortless effort”, so to speak, divested of goal-orientation and expectation.
	It is precisely this way of contemplating that in turn enables one to proceed independently, “without clinging to anything in the world” f experience, as stipulated in the final part of the “refrain”.^i99
 In several discourses, the stipulation to abide “without clinging to anything in the world” occurs immediately before realization takes place.^i100
 This suggests that with this part of the “refrain”, satipaṭṭhāna ^pg129 contemplation gradually builds up to the constellation of mental qualities required for the event of awakening.
 According to the commentaries, “to abide independently” refers to the absence of dependency through craving and speculative views, while to avoid “clinging to anything in the world” stands for not identifying with any of the five aggregates.^i101
	By letting go of all dependencies and cravings during this advanced level of practice, a deepening realization of the empty nature of all phenomena dawns on the meditator.
 With this state of independence and equipoise, characterized by the absence of any sense of “I” or “mine”, the direct path of satipaṭṭhāna gradually approaches its culmination.
 It is in this balanced state of mind, free from “I”-making or “my”-making, that the realization of Nibbāna can take place.^pg130
body	^yf(THE BODY)
^yf1(THE BODY CONTEMPLATIONS)
Starting with this chapter, I will consider the actual meditation practices described in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta.
 The practices listed under the first satipaṭṭhāna, contemplation of the body, comprise awareness of breathing, awareness of bodily postures, clear knowledge in regard to bodily activities, analysis of the body into its anatomical parts, analysis of the body into its elementary qualities, and contemplation of a dead body in nine consecutive stages of decay.
 I will examine each of these meditation practices in turn, after an introductory assessment of body contemplation in general.
	The sequence of the body contemplations is progressive, beginning with the more obvious and basic aspects of the body and continuing towards a more detailed and analytical understanding of the nature of the body.
 This pattern becomes all the more evident if one transposes mindfulness of breathing from the first position to the third, after awareness of postures and clear knowledge in regard to bodily activities, a position it assumes in the Chinese Madhyama Āgama and in two other versions of satipaṭṭhāna (cf. Fig. 6.1 below).^i1
Through this shift in position, awareness of the body’s postures and ^pg131 clear knowledge of activities would precede mindfulness of breathing, rather than following it as they do in the Pāli versions.

breathing four postures
^fig6.1(The body contemplations) 
	Awareness of the four postures and clear knowledge of activities can be characterized as simpler and more rudimentary forms of contemplation than the other body contemplations.
 Taking into consideration their more elementary character, it seems reasonable to place them at the beginning of a cultivation of satipaṭṭhāna, as convenient ways to build up a foundation in sati.
 This, however, does not imply that in actual practice mindfulness of breathing need always be preceded by awareness of postures and clear knowledge of activities, since mindfulness of the breath can also be followed by mindfulness of one’s postures and activities.
	Awareness of postures and clear knowledge of activities are predominantly concerned with the body in action.
 In comparison, the remaining exercises examine the body in a more static manner, analysing it into its constituent components from anatomical, material, and temporal perspectives (by focusing on its disintegration after death).
 In this context, mindfulness of breathing has a transitional role, since although it is traditionally carried out in the stable sitting posture, it is still concerned with an active aspect of the body, namely the process of breathing.
 When it is shifted to the third position, mindfulness of breathing becomes the first in a series of ^pg132 practices conducted mainly in the sitting posture.
 In fact, the proper sitting posture is described in detail only in the instructions for mindfulness of breathing.
 Since awareness of the four postures and clear knowledge in regard to bodily activities are forms of contemplation that take place in different postures, it makes sense to introduce the sitting posture only when it becomes relevant.
 This is the case for mindfulness of breathing and the remaining exercises, whose comparative subtlety requires a fairly stable posture, thereby facilitating the development of deeper degrees of concentration.
 By shifting mindfulness of breathing to the third position, the description of the sitting posture also moves to the most convenient position within the body contemplations.
	The body contemplations begin with an emphasis on “knowing”
(pajānāti, sampajānakāri) in the two exercises concerned with bodily postures and activities and in the first two steps of mindfulness of breathing.
 Subsequent exercises introduce slightly different methods of contemplation.
 The third and fourth steps of mindfulness of breathing are concerned with “training” (sikkhati), the two bodily analyses with “considering” (paccavekkhati),^i2 and the contemplation of a corpse in decay with “comparing” (upasaṃharati).
 This change in the choice of verbs underscores a progression from comparatively simple acts of observation to more sophisticated forms of analysis.
 Here again mindfulness of breathing assumes a transitional role, with its first steps partaking of the character of the two contemplations of postures and of activities, while its third and fourth steps can be grouped together with the other three contemplations.
	Except for awareness of the four postures and clear knowledge in regard to activities, each of the other body contemplations is illustrated by a simile.
 These similes compare mindfulness of breathing to a turner at his lathe, contemplation of the anatomical parts to examining a bag full of grains, and contemplation of the four elements to butchering a cow.
 The last exercise employs mental images of a body in various stages of decay.
 Although these stages of decay cannot be reckoned as similes, the use of mental imagery here parallels the similes given in the other three exercises.
 These similes and mental images point to an additional degree of affinity between mindfulness of breathing and the final three body contemplations,
 and ^pg133 thereby further support the idea of presenting them together by shifting mindfulness of breathing to the third position in the sequence of the body contemplations.
	The instruction for contemplating the anatomical parts employs the word “impure” (asuci), which betrays a certain degree of evaluation inherent in this type of practice.^i3
 In a passage from the Aṅguttara Nikāya, contemplation of the anatomical parts and of a corpse in decay come under the “recollection” (anussati) category.^i4
 This evokes sati’s connotations of memory and shows that these two contemplations imply to some extent a form of practice which is not confined to bare awareness only.
	The breadth of “body contemplation” as a satipaṭṭhāna becomes even more extensive in the Chinese version found in the Madhyama Āgama, which adds several meditations to those described in the Pāli discourses.
 Surprisingly, at least at first sight, the Madhyama Āgama counts the development of the four absorptions as body contemplations.^i5
However, the positioning of the four absorptions under body contemplation has a parallel in the Kāyagatāsati Sutta of the Pāli canon, which also directs awareness to the effect these absorptions have on the physical body.^i6
Thus it is not too far-fetched to take the physical bliss experienced during absorption as an object of contemplation of the body.
 Nevertheless, several of the additional contemplations in the Madhyama Āgama do not fit well into “body contemplation”, but seem rather to be the outcome of a progressive assimilation of other practices under this heading.^i7^pg134
	The Chinese Ekottara Āgama version, on the other hand, contains only four body contemplations in total: awareness of the anatomical parts, of the four elements, of a rotting corpse, and a contemplation of the various bodily orifices together with the impure liquids discharged by them.^i8
 An even more abridged version can be found in the Pāli Vibhaṅga, which lists only contemplation of the anatomical constitution under this satipaṭṭhāna. ^i9
 The reasons for these “omissions” are open to conjecture, but what remains as the unanimously accepted core of the contemplation of the body in all the different versions is a thorough investigation of its anatomical constitution.
 This gives a considerable degree of emphasis to this exercise,^i10 even though it does involve some degree of evaluation and therefore seems different from the typical satipaṭṭhāna approach to contemplation.
benefits	^yf2(PURPOSE AND BENEFITS OF CONTEMPLATION OF THE BODY)
Although contemplating the nature of the body highlights its less attractive features, the purpose of this exercise is not to demonize the body.
 While it is certainly true that at times the discourses describe the human body in rather negative terms,^i11 some of these instances occur in a particular context in which the point being made is that the speakers in question have overcome all attachment to their^pg135 body.^i12
 In contrast, the Kāyagatāsati Sutta takes the physical bliss of absorption attainment as an object for body contemplation.
 This passage clearly demonstrates that contemplation of the body is not necessarily linked to repugnance and loathing.
	The purpose of contemplating the nature of the body is to bring its unattractive aspects to the forefront of one’s attention, thereby placing the attractive aspects previously emphasized in a more balanced context.
 The aim is a balanced and detached attitude towards the body.
 With such a balanced attitude, one sees the body merely as a product of conditions, a product with which one need not identify.^i13
	The discourses illustrate the practice and benefits of contemplating the body with a variety of similes.
 One of these similes depicts a man carrying a bowl brimming with oil on his head through a crowd watching a beautiful girl singing and dancing.^i14
 He is followed by another man with a drawn sword, ready to cut off his head if even one drop of oil is spilled.
 To preserve his life, the man carrying the oil has to apply his full attention to each step and movement, without allowing the commotion around the girl to distract him.
	The careful behaviour of the man carrying the oil exemplifies the circumspect behaviour of a practitioner well established in present moment awareness of the body.
 The image of carrying an object on the head in particular points to the balance and centredness that accompany bodily activities carried out with sati.
 Another important aspect of this simile is that it relates sustained awareness of the body’s activities to sense-restraint.
 In this way it vividly illustrates the importance of developing awareness grounded in the body, since in the situation depicted in this simile restraint of the senses through being grounded in the body constitutes the means to preserve one’s life in the midst of commotion and danger.^pg136
	Sense-restraint comes up again in another simile, which compares mindfulness of the body to a strong post to which six different wild animals are bound.^i15
 Since the animals are firmly bound to the post, however much they might struggle to escape, they have sooner or later to sit or lie down next to the post.
 Similarly, mindfulness of the body can become a strong post for tethering the six senses.
	This simile compares the mental agitation of searching for sensual gratification to wild animals struggling to go in different directions.
 Once the post of body mindfulness is firmly established, however, the senses will invariably have to calm down, just as the animals will come to lie down next to the post to which they are bound.
 This simile points to the benefit of being anchored or grounded in the experience of the present moment through mindfulness of the body.^i16
 Lacking such grounding in body awareness, attachment and clinging can easily arise.^i17
	A similar connotation underlies a set of similes in the Kāyagatāsati Sutta, which present mindfulness of the body as a crucial factor for withstanding Māra, the personification of mental defilements.^i18
 Just as a heavy stone ball can penetrate a mound of wet clay, or just as fire can be produced from dry wood, or just as an empty jug can be filled with water, so too will Māra find an opportunity to overpower those who are not well established in mindfulness of the body.
 But just as a light ball of string cannot penetrate a door panel made of heartwood, or just as fire cannot be produced from wet wood, or just as a full jug cannot take more water, so too will Māra be unable to overpower those who develop and cultivate mindfulness of the body.
	The Kāyagatāsati Sutta contains the same sequence of body contemplations as the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta.
 There is, however, a notable difference in the Kāyagatāsati Sutta’s version of the “refrain”, which relates body contemplation to the overcoming of worldly thoughts and the development of concentration.^i19
 This points to another ^pg137 important benefit of body contemplation: overcoming sensual infatuation through a proper assessment of the nature of the body.
 Such waning of sensual infatuation facilitates the development of concentration unhindered by sensual distractions.
 The Kāyagatāsati Sutta illustrates this with another set of similes: just as drinking water will flow out if a jug is tipped over, or just as water in a pond will flow out if the embankment is broken, or just as a skilled driver is able to drive a chariot wherever he likes, so too mindfulness of the body will lead easily to the development of deep concentration.^i20
	Thus contemplation of the body can become a basis for the development of samatha, or it can lead to an application of sati to feelings and mental phenomena, as described in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta.^i21
 The fact that a firm grounding of awareness in the body provides an important basis for the development of both calm and insight may be why, of the four satipaṭṭhānas, body contemplation has received the most extensive and detailed treatment in the discourses and commentaries.^i22
 This emphasis on the body contemplations continues today in the vipassanā schools of the Theravāda tradition, where mindfulness of the body occupies a central position as a foundational satipaṭṭhāna practice.
	The discourses repeatedly emphasize the great value of mindfulness of the body.^i23
 According to them, those who do not practise mindfulness of the body do not “partake of the deathless”.^i24
 Mindfulness of the body is a source of joy,^i25 and can truly be considered one’s best friend.^i26
 A verse from the Theragāthā even reports a monk^pg138 reflecting that if he were granted only one wish, it would be that the whole world might enjoy unbroken mindfulness of the body.^i27
	Although meditation practices for contemplating the body appear to have had ancient origins and were already known in ascetic and contemplative circles contemporary with the Buddha,^i28
 the commentaries point out that his analytical and comprehensive approach was a distinctively new feature.^i29
beathing	^yf3(MINDFULNESS OF BREATHING)
In ancient times, and still today, mindfulness of breathing might well be the most widely used method of body contemplation.
 The Buddha himself frequently engaged in mindfulness of breathing,^i30
 which he called a “noble” and “divine” way of practice.^i31
 According to his own statement, even his awakening took place based on mindfulness of breathing.^i32
	The discourses present mindfulness of breathing in a variety of ways.
 The Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta describes four steps of the practice, to which the Ānāpānasati Sutta adds another twelve, thereby forming a scheme of altogether sixteen steps.
 Elsewhere the discourses speak of mindfulness of breathing as a cognition (saññā), and as a concentration practice.^i33
 These various presentations demonstrate the multifunctional character of the process of breathing as a meditation object.
 This much is also documented in the range of its possible benefits, which include both penetrative insight and deep concentration.^i34^pg139
	As a meditation practice, mindfulness of breathing has a peaceful character and leads to stability of both posture and mind.^i35
 The mental stability brought about through mindfulness of breathing acts in particular as an antidote to distraction and discursive thought.^i36
 Awareness of the breath can also become a stabilizing factor at the time of death, ensuring that even one’s last breath will be a mindful one.^i37
	According to the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, the practice of mindfulness of breathing should be undertaken in the following way:
^sutta Here, gone to the forest, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, he sits down; having folded his legs crosswise, set his body erect, and established mindfulness in front of him, mindful he breathes in, mindful he breathes out.
^sutta Breathing in long, he knows “I breathe in long,” breathing out long, he knows “I breathe out long.” Breathing in short, he knows “I breathe in short”, breathing out short, he knows “I breathe out short.” He trains thus: “I shall breathe in experiencing the whole body,” he trains thus: “I shall breathe out experiencing the whole body.” He trains thus: “I shall breathe in calming the bodily formation,” he trains thus: “I shall breathe out calming the bodily formation”.^i38
	The instructions for mindfulness of breathing include the appropriate external environment and the suitable physical posture.
 The three kinds of places recommended for practice are a forest, the root of a tree, and an empty hut.
 In the discourses, these three usually indicate suitable conditions for the practice of formal meditation,^i39
 representing the appropriate degree of seclusion required for mindfulness of breathing (or other meditation practices).^i40
 According to modern meditation teachers, however, mindfulness of breathing^pg140 can be developed in any situation, even while, for example, standing in a queue or sitting in a waiting-room.^i41
	As well as describing the external environment, the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta also specifies the proper sitting posture: the back should be kept straight and the legs crossed.^i42
 In the discourses, this description of the appropriate posture for meditation occurs not only in relation to mindfulness of breathing, but also in the context of several other meditation practices.^i43
 Although this does not imply that meditation should be confined to the sitting posture only, these occurrences nevertheless clearly underline the importance of formal sitting for cultivating the mind.^pg141
	Once the posture is set up, mindfulness is to be established “in front”.
 The injunction “in front” (parimukhaṃ) can be understood literally or figuratively.^i44
 Following the more literal understanding, “in front” indicates the nostril area as the most appropriate for attention to the in- and out-breaths.
 Alternatively, “in front” understood more figuratively suggests a firm establishment of sati, sati being mentally “in front” in the sense of meditative composure and attentiveness.^i45
	Both the Abhidhamma and the commentaries take “in front” (parimukhaṃ) to indicate a precise anatomical location.^i46
 In the discourses, however, the specification “in front” occurs in a variety of contexts, such as, for example, in relation to overcoming the hindrances or to developing the divine abodes (brahmavihāra).^i47^pg142
 Although overcoming the hindrances can occur with the aid of mindfulness of breathing, this is not necessarily the case.
 In fact, the standard instructions for overcoming the hindrances do not mention the breath.^i48
 Similarly, the discourses do not relate the development of the divine abodes in any way to awareness of the breath.^i49
 Apart from awareness of the breath, however, to direct mindfulness to the nostril area makes little sense, whether in relation to overcoming the hindrances or to developing the divine abodes.
 Thus, at least in these contexts, the figurative sense of “in front” as a firm establishment of sati is the more meaningful alternative.
	Therefore, although to understand “in front” to indicate the nostril area makes sense in relation to mindfulness of breathing, alternative ways of practice, based on a more figurative understanding of the term, cannot be categorically excluded.
 In fact, several modern teachers have developed successful approaches to mindfulness of breathing independent of the nostril area.
 Some, for example, advise their pupils to experience the breath in the chest area, others suggest observing the air element at the abdomen, while still others recommend directing awareness to the act of breathing itself, without focusing on any specific location.^i50^pg143
	Having described the appropriate environment and posture, the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta instructs the meditator to breathe in and out mindfully.^i51
 Next, the meditator should become aware of the length of each breath as “long” or “short”.
 The point here is to be aware of long and short breaths, not consciously to control the length of the breath.
 Nevertheless, the progression from knowing longer breaths to knowing shorter breaths reflects the fact that the breath naturally becomes shorter and finer with continued contemplation, owing to increasing mental and physical calmness.^i52
	The discourse compares this progress to a skilled turner who attends to his lathe with full awareness of making a long turn or a short turn.^i53
 The simile of the turner suggests increasing degrees of refinement and subtlety in practising mindfulness of breathing.^i54
Just as a turner makes progressively finer and more delicate cuts on the lathe, contemplation proceeds from long and comparatively gross breaths to shorter and subtler breaths.
 The Paṭisambhidāmagga compares this progressive refinement of mindfulness of breathing to the progressively fainter sound of a gong after it has been struck.^i55
	The third and fourth steps introduce a different verb to describe the process of contemplation: in place of “he knows” (pajānāti), the text now uses the expression “he trains” (sikkhati).^i56
 In the Ānāpānasati Sutta, this “training” covers altogether fourteen steps, in addition to the first two steps concerned with “knowing”.
 The use of the word “training” indicates some degree of additional effort on the part of the meditator, owing to an increased degree of difficulty in these steps.^i57
 Such training seems to entail a shift to a broader kind^pg144 of awareness, which also includes phenomena other than the breath itself.
	In the scheme described in the Ānāpānasati Sutta, awareness moves through sixteen steps, which proceed from the bodily phenomena of breathing to feelings, mental events, and the development of insight.
 Considering the range of these sixteen steps it becomes evident that mindfulness of breathing is not limited to changes in the process of breathing, but covers related aspects of subjective experience.
 Undertaken in this way, mindfulness of breathing becomes a skilful tool for self-observation.^i58
	The third and fourth steps of mindfulness of breathing, alike in both the Ānāpānasati Sutta and the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, are concerned with experiencing the “whole body” (sabbakāya) and with calming the “bodily formation” (kāyasaṅkhāra).
 In the present context, the “whole body” can be taken literally to refer to the whole physical body.
 Understood in this way, the instruction points to a broadening of awareness, a shift from the breath alone to its effect on the entire body.^i59
 According to the commentaries, however, the “whole body” should be understood to refer, more figuratively, to the “body” of the breath.
 By understanding the “whole body” as the whole breath-body the instruction then indicates full awareness of the beginning, middle, and end stages of each breath.^i60
 This interpretation can claim support from the same Ānāpānasati Sutta, since the Buddha here identified the breath as a “body” (kāya) among bodies.^i61
 An argument against this interpretation, however, could be that the cultivation of full awareness of the length of the breath was the task of the previous two steps, knowing a long or a short breath, which already required the meditator to be aware of each breath^pg145 from beginning to end.^i62
 One would therefore expect this next step in the progression to introduce a distinctly new feature for contemplation, such as, for example, a shift of awareness to include the whole physical body.
	The next step of training is the calming of the “bodily formation”(kāyasaṅkhāra).
 Elsewhere the discourses define the “bodily formation” as in-breathing and out-breathing.^i63
 This dovetails with the second interpretation above, according to which “whole body” refers to the whole length of the breath.^i64
 The Paṭisambhidāmagga and the Vimuttimagga indicate that this fourth step of mindfulness of breathing also refers to maintenance of a calm and stable posture, in the sense of calming any inclination to move.^i65
 Thus the instruction to calm the bodily formations also implies an increase in general bodily calmness, an understanding that fits with the first interpretation mentioned above, taking “body” to refer to the anatomical body.
 In the end, both interpretations overlap, since a calming of the breath naturally leads to increased bodily tranquillity and vice versa.^i66
	Such calming of breath and body can then either become the basis for developing awareness of the inner constitution of the body, as in the subsequent satipaṭṭhāna exercises, or else lead to an awareness of feelings and mental processes, as in the sixteen steps.^i67
 In both cases this constitutes a natural progression in which the establishment of a basis in bodily calmness enables awareness to proceed to subtler^pg146 aspects of contemplation.
 I will now consider these subtler aspects by briefly digressing from the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta and examining further the scheme of sixteen steps described in the Ānāpānasati Sutta.
anapanasati	^yf4(THE ĀNĀPĀNASATI SUTTA)
Subsequent to the first four steps of mindfulness of breathing, the Ānāpānasati Sutta’s contemplation scheme directs awareness to the experience of joy (pīti) and happiness (sukha).
 Since these two are factors of absorption, their occurrence in this part of the sixteen steps has led the Visuddhimagga to the assumption that this progression refers exclusively to absorption experience.^i68
 Possibly because of this assumption, even the first four steps of mindfulness of breathing in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta have at times been identified as being no more than a concentration practice.^i69
	Here it needs to be noted that the occurrence of joy (pīti) and happiness (sukha) as steps five and six in the scheme of the Ānāpānasati Sutta does not necessarily require the experience of absorption,^pg147 since both can occur apart from such attainment.^i70
 According to a verse in the Dhammapada, for example, joy (pīti) can arise as a result of insight meditation.^i71
 Thus awareness of the breath whilst experiencing joy or happiness is not necessarily confined to retrospective analysis after emerging from an absorption attainment, nor to the stages of calmness meditation immediately preceding such attainment.
	Although the breath can undoubtedly be used for the development of concentration, the instructions throughout the sixteen steps are invariably based on distinct awareness of each in- and out-breath.
 The central purpose of this distinction is to cultivate awareness of the impermanent nature of the breath.
 Any bodily or mental phenomena coming within the focus of awareness during the sixteen steps are experienced against the background of the ever-changing rhythm of in- and out-breaths, which provides a constant reminder of impermanence (cf. Fig. 6.2 opposite).^i72
	Thus a closer inspection of the sixteen steps reveals an underlying progressive pattern which proceeds through increasingly subtle aspects of subjective experience against a constant background of impermanence.^i73
 In contrast, on approaching absorption attainment experience becomes more and more unified, so that one is no longer clearly aware of the distinction between in- and out-breaths, or related phenomena.
	The basic difference between mindfulness of breathing as a samatha or as a vipassanā practice depends on what angle is taken when observing the breath, since emphasis on just mentally knowing the presence of the breath is capable of leading to deep levels of ^pg148 concentration, while emphasis on various phenomena related to the process of breathing does not lead to a unitary type of experience but stays in the realm of variety and of sensory experience, and thus is more geared towards the development of insight.
 These considerations suggest that the sixteen steps are not solely a concentration practice, but also introduce an insight perspective on the development of mindfulness of breathing.

^fig6.2(Survey of ānāpānasati in sixteen steps) ^pg149
	An examination of the context in which the sixteen steps are taught in the Ānāpānasati Sutta supports this suggestion.
 According to the introductory section of the discourse the Buddha’s rationale for giving this discourse was to demonstrate to a group of monks, who were already using the breath as a meditation object (possibly as a concentration exercise), how to develop it as a satipaṭṭhāna. ^i74
That is, the Buddha took up the breath as a meditation object in order to demonstrate how sati can naturally lead from mindfulness of breathing to a comprehensive awareness of feelings, mind, and dhammas, and hence to a development of all satipaṭṭhānas and to the arising of the seven awakening factors.^i75
 Thus the main purpose of the Buddha’s exposition was to broaden the scope of mindfulness of breathing from awareness of the bodily phenomenon breath to awareness of feelings, mind, and dhammas, and in this way employ it as a means to gain insight.^i76
 In view of this it seems reasonable to conclude that the purpose of the sixteen steps of mindfulness of breathing described in the Ānāpānasati Sutta, and by implication the purpose of the four steps of mindfulness of breathing in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, is not restricted to the development of concentration, but covers both calm and insight.
postures	^ye5(POSTURES AND ACTIVITIES)
Returning to the satipaṭṭhāna contemplations, the next two exercises described in the discourse, awareness of the four postures and clear knowledge in regard to activities, are both concerned with directing mindfulness to the body in activity.
 The instructions for contemplating the four postures are:
	^sutta When walking, he knows ”I am walking“;
 when standing, he knows ”I am standing“;
 when sitting, he knows ”I am sitting“;
 when lying down, he knows ”I am lying down“;
 or he knows accordingly however his body is disposed.^i77
	The enumeration of the four postures in the above instruction proceeds from the more active walking to comparatively more refined and passive postures.^i78
 The instruction here is to “know” each of these postures, probably implying some form of proprioceptive awareness.^i79
 In other discourses, these four postures often convey the sense of doing something “at any time”.^i80
 Applied to the context ^pg150 of satipaṭṭhāna, this usage suggests continuity of body awareness during all activities.
 In fact, according to the above instruction this contemplation is not limited to the four postures, but includes any way one’s body might be positioned.
 Thus what this particular contemplation means, practically speaking, is to be aware of the body in a general manner, to be “with” the body during its natural activities, instead of being carried away by various thoughts and ideas, and therefore to be mentally anchored in the body.
	This particular exercise constitutes the satipaṭṭhāna contemplation that most prominently fulfils the role of providing a firm grounding of awareness in the body.
 Because of this foundational role, it seems reasonable to follow the Madhyama Āgama version of satipaṭṭhāna and place it at the beginning of the body contemplations.
 For the beginner in satipaṭṭhāna, this simple exercise of being aware of the body, in whatever position, helps to build up continuity of sati.
 By performing even the least important movement of the body in a conscious and deliberate manner, the most mundane activities can be turned into occasions for mental development.
 Awareness trained in this way constitutes an important foundation for more formal meditation, since diligent practice of this contemplation will bring the mind’s tendency to distraction considerably under control.
	Awareness of the four postures is not only a way to build up mindfulness; the four bodily postures can also be used as objects of insightful investigation.
 A verse from the Theragāthā, for example, relates the ability to assume any of the four postures to the inter- action of the bones and tendons in the body responsible for that posture.^i81
 By describing the mechanics behind bodily activities in this way, this verse points to a perspective on contemplating the body which has received much attention from modern meditation teachers.^i82
 The mechanics involved in assuming a bodily posture or performing a movement usually escape notice owing to one’s preoccupation with the outcome of one’s action.
 In particular, a practical example for investigating the activity of walking can be found in the commentaries, which suggest breaking down the process of walking into the successive stages of a single step, which can then be correlated with the four elements.^i83^pg151
	As mentioned above, the four postures are often used in the discourses as a way to indicate that something should be done “at any time”.
 In this way, they are at times related to various predominantly mental events such as fear, unwholesome thoughts, or overcoming the five hindrances.^i84
 These passages relate each of the four postures to awareness of the concurrent state of mind.
 This indicates that removing unwholesome states of mind, for example, is not confined to formal sitting meditation, but can and should be undertaken in any situation or posture.
 The fact that meditation does not have to be exclusively associated with the sitting posture is also recognized in the Vimuttimagga and the Visuddhimagga, which indicate that, depending on the character of individual meditators, other postures may be adopted for carrying out the practice of meditation.^i85
	Another possibility suggested by the fact that the discourses relate the four postures to various states of mind is to observe the interrelation between states of mind and the way one performs activities like walking, sitting, etc.
 Through such observation one can become aware of how a particular state of mind expresses itself through one’s bodily posture, or how the condition, position, and motion of the body affects the mind.^i86
 Bodily posture and state of mind are intrinsically interrelated, so that clear awareness of the one naturally enhances awareness of the other.
 In this way, contemplation of the four postures can lead to an investigation of the body’s conditional interrelation with the mind.^pg152
	This particular contemplation can also lead one to question the sense of identity underlying any of the four postures.^i87
 The commentaries give a practical shape to this suggestion, since according to them the decisive difference between simple walking and walking meditation as a satipaṭṭhāna is that a meditator keeps in mind the question: “Who goes? Whose is this going?”^i88
	Another perspective on the development of insight can be gained by turning awareness to minor postural adjustments.
 The main reason for these adjustments is to avoid the physical pain that develops when the same posture is maintained for a long time.
 Through closer observation it will become evident that most of the semi-conscious adjustments made in any posture are a constant effort to alleviate the pain inherent in having a body.^i89
	Of these four postures, the discourses individually relate walking and reclining to the development of awareness.
 Walking meditation often comes up circumstantially in the discourses when a visitor, on approaching a settlement of monks, finds them practising walking meditation in the open.^i90
 Several passages report the Buddha and some of his senior disciples engaged in walking meditation.^i91
 This ^pg153 shows that even accomplished practitioners considered walking meditation a worthwhile practice.
 According to the discourses, walking meditation benefits bodily health and digestion, and leads to the development of sustained concentration.^i92
 The commentaries document the insight potential of walking meditation with instances of its use that led to full realization.^i93
	Unlike the way in which walking meditation is usually practised nowadays, the standard instructions for walking meditation found in the discourses take mental events as their main object of observation.
 The instructions in this context do not mention awareness of one’s bodily posture or of the dynamics of walking, but speak of purifying the mind from obstructive states.^i94
 Since the same expression is also used for sitting meditation, it simply implies a continuation of the same meditation that has earlier been practised while seated, albeit in a different posture.
	A discourse in the Aṅguttara Nikāya recommends walking meditation as an antidote for drowsiness.
 In this case, however, the instructions are different from the standard descriptions: the meditator is to focus on the walking path, to keep the senses withdrawn, and to prevent the mind from getting distracted outwardly.^i95
	To cultivate awareness in regard to the reclining posture, meditators should lie down mindfully on their right side to rest during the middle part of the night, keeping in mind the time to wake up.^i96
 The instructions for falling asleep mindfully appear to be mainly concerned with waking up at a predetermined time.^i97
 According to other passages, falling asleep with awareness improves ^pg154 the quality of one’s sleep and prevents bad dreams and nocturnal emissions.^i98
	By way of conclusion it should be underlined that, in spite of these various perspectives on developing insight related to the four postures,
 what the instructions in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta itself suggest is simply awareness of the whole body in general, and of its disposition in space.
	Once mindfulness of the four postures has led to a grounding of awareness in the body, one can turn to the next contemplation introduced in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta: clear knowing (sampajāna) in regard to a range of bodily activities.^i99
 The instructions for such clear knowing are:
	^sutta When going forward and returning he acts clearly knowing;
 when looking ahead and looking away he acts clearly knowing;
 when flexing and extending his limbs he acts clearly knowing;
 when wearing his robes and carrying his outer robe and bowl he acts clearly knowing;
 when eating, drinking, consuming food, and tasting he acts clearly knowing;
 when defecating and urinating he acts clearly knowing;
 when walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up, talking, and keeping silent he acts clearly knowing.^i100
	Apart from being one of the body contemplations in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, this exercise also forms a distinct step in the gradual path of training, referred to as “mindfulness and clear knowledge” (satisampajañña).^i101
 In the sequence of this gradual path of training, mindfulness and clear knowledge in regard to bodily activities occupy a transitional place between a preparatory development and actual ^pg155 sitting meditation.^i102
 To be more precise, mindfulness and clear knowledge complete the preliminary stages concerned with ethical conduct, restraint, and contentment, and form the starting point for the formal practice of meditation, when one resorts to a secluded place in order to overcome the hindrances, to progress through the levels of absorption, and to gain realization.^i103
 Thus the development of mindfulness and clear knowledge is a foundation for more formal meditations such as, in the present context, the remaining contemplations described in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta.^i104
	The combined expression “mindfulness and clear knowledge” indicates that, in addition to being mindful of the activities mentioned, the presence of “clear knowledge” plays an important role.
Since “clearly knowing” on its own, and also in combination with sati, occurs in the discourses in a variety of contexts and can assume a broad range of meanings,^i105 the question arises of the implications of “clear knowledge” in regard to the various activities mentioned.^pg156
Neither the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta nor the expositions of the gradual path offer further information.
 The commentaries make up for this by presenting a detailed analysis of clear knowledge into four aspects (cf. Fig. 6.3 below).
 According to them, clear knowledge should be directed to the purpose of an activity and also to its suitability.
Moreover one should clearly understand how to relate this activity to one’s meditation practice (one’s “pasture”) and one should also develop “non-delusion” by clearly understanding the true nature of reality.^i106
 A closer inspection of the discourses brings to light several passages that support or further clarify this commentarial presentation.
fig6.3	purpose (sātthakasampajañña)
suitability (sappāyasampajañña)
“pasture” (gocarasampajañña)
non-delusion (asammohasampajañña)
^fig6.3(Four aspects of “clear knowledge” in the commentaries) 
	According to the Mahāsuññata Sutta, talking can be carried out clearly knowing by refraining from topics unsuitable for one who has gone forth.^i107
 Here, “clearly knowing” implies that one discusses topics related to contentment, seclusion, concentration, wisdom, etc., since in this way speech becomes “purposeful” in regard to one’s progress on the path.
 This instance parallels the first aspect of clear knowledge mentioned in the commentaries, which is concerned with the purpose of an activity.
	Several of the activities listed in this part of the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, such as “going forward and returning”, “looking ahead and looking away”, “flexing and extending one’s limbs”, and “wearing one’s robes and carrying one’s outer robe and bowl”, occur as a set^pg157 elsewhere in the discourses.^i108
 These instances do not explicitly mention clear knowledge, but are instructions given to monks regarding proper behaviour.
 What the discourses emphasize in regard to these activities, is that they should be performed in a graceful and pleasing way (pāsādika).^i109
 Similarly, the Chinese Madhyama Āgama speaks of a monk’s “dignified and quiet behaviour” when practising clear knowledge in regard to bodily activities.^i110
 Judging from these passages, this particular set of activities stands for a careful and dignified way of behaving, appropriate to one who is living as a monk or nun.
	The need to maintain such standards of good conduct has found its expression in the numerous training rules for the monastic community.
 These regulate, in great detail, various aspects of daily conduct.^i111
 The importance accorded to the externals of conduct in ancient India is also evident in the Brahmāyu Sutta, where a close examination of the Buddha’s daily conduct formed part of an attempt to assess his spiritual accomplishment.^i112
 This need for a monk or nun to behave in a careful and dignified manner parallels the second aspect of clear knowledge mentioned in the commentaries, which relates it to the suitability of an action.
	A passage from the Aṅguttara Nikāya associates clearly knowing with the activity of looking.
 This passage reports the monk Nanda, who was a particularly lustful character, marshalling all his effort in order to avoid the arising of desires and discontent (abhijjhādomanassa) when looking in any direction.^i113
 The terminology used in this instance shows that this form of clearly knowing is related to sense-restraint.
 A similar nuance can be found in the^pg158 Mahāsuññata Sutta, which relates clearly knowing in regard to the four postures to sense-restraint.^i114
 Both passages correspond to the third aspect of clear knowledge mentioned in the commentaries, which speaks of “pasture”.
 The same expression came up earlier in relation to sati imagery, depicting satipaṭṭhāna as the proper pasture of a monk, while improper pasture represented sensual distraction.^i115
 This suggests that clear knowledge in regard to “pasture” refers in particular to sense-restraint.
	The fourth aspect mentioned in the commentaries, which associates clear knowledge with the absence of delusion (asammoha), goes beyond the context of body contemplation.
 To have a clear understanding of the true nature of reality is a task of clearly knowing (sampajāna) in general, a quality that, according to the “definition”, needs to be developed with all the satipaṭṭhāna contemplations.
	The commentarial presentation of the four aspects inherent in clear knowledge can be seen to follow a progressive sequence,
 with clearly knowing in regard to purpose (one’s progress to awakening) establishing the background for corresponding “suitable” conduct,
 which in turn facilitates sense-restraint and one’s meditative development, which then enables insight into the true nature of reality to arise.
 In this way, the satipaṭṭhāna practice of developing clear knowledge in regard to activities combines purposeful and dignified conduct with sense-restraint in order to build up a foundation for the arising of insight.
 In fact, both proper conduct and senserestraint overlap to some degree, since several aspects of a monk’s or a nun’s code of conduct are intended to facilitate sense-restraint,
 while on the other hand one’s bodily activities will become more graceful and dignified if a certain degree of mental equilibrium through the absence of sensual distractions has been established.
	Compared to contemplation of the four postures, clear knowledge in regard to activities introduces an additional element, since the former consists only in bare awareness of whatever posture or movement occurred naturally,
 while the latter includes purposely adopting a restrained and dignified behaviour.^pg159
anatomy	^yf6(ANATOMICAL PARTS AND ELEMENTS)
The next two exercises listed in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, contemplating the anatomical constitution of the body and contemplating the body in terms of the four elements, both direct mindfulness to an analysis of the body’s constitution.
 The first of these two analytical meditations surveys the constitution of one’s body by listing various anatomical parts, organs, and fluids.^i116
 The passage reads:
	^sutta He reviews this same body up from the soles of the feet and down from the top of the hair, enclosed by skin, as full of many kinds of impurity thus:
 ”in this body there are head-hairs, body-hairs, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone-marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, bowel, mesentery, contents of the stomach, faeces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, spittle, snot, oil of the joints, and urine“.^i117
	In other discourses, this list of anatomical parts is followed by the expression: “and whatever other parts there may be”.^i118
 This indicates that the satipaṭṭhāna list is not exhaustive and the items mentioned are examples of the kinds of bodily parts that can be contemplated.
In fact, other passages mention several bodily parts or fluids missing from this list, such as the brain, the male organ, or ear-wax, which demonstrates that the satipaṭṭhāna list does not exhaust the ancient Indian knowledge of human anatomy.^i119
	The set of anatomical parts given in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta follows a natural sequence from the solid and outer parts, through the internal^pg160 organs, to the organic liquids.
 This sequence represents a progressive penetration of awareness.
 The parts most easily accessible to awareness are mentioned first, while the aspects of the body listed further on in the sequence require a deeper degree of awareness and sensitivity.
 Alternatively, the sequence can also be taken to correspond to an exercise in imaginative visualization, during which one strips one’s body of each part in turn.^i120
	The Visuddhimagga indicates that the practice of this exercise progresses from giving attention to each individual anatomical part to becoming aware of all of them together.^i121
 This suggests that with the more advanced stages of this contemplation the individual parts recede in importance and awareness turns to the composite and unattractive nature of the body in its entirety.
 According to the Sampasādanīya Sutta, contemplation can also proceed from the anatomical parts to awareness of the skeleton only.^i122
	A progressive pattern similar to the satipaṭṭhāna instructions can be found in the Vijaya Sutta of the Sutta Nipāta, where a thorough investigation of the body leads from its outer anatomical parts to its inner organs and liquids.^i123
 In the Vijaya Sutta, this investigation of the body concludes with the rhetorical question: “How else, except through lack of insight, could one exalt oneself or disparage another because of such a body?”^i124
 This conclusion shows that the aim of the contemplation described is to reduce one’s attachment to the body, a suggestion that holds true also for the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta.
 The Chinese Ekottara Āgama lists a related contemplation as part of^pg161 its version of body contemplation.
 This exercise is concerned with the bodily orifices, directing awareness to the repulsive nature of the excretions from each of them.^i125
 The same exercise occurs in other discourses in the Pāli Nikāyas.^i126
 The main purpose of this exercise, and of contemplating the anatomical parts, is to drive home the realization that one’s own body and the bodies of others are not inherently attractive.^i127
 A related nuance can be found in another discourse which refers to contemplating the anatomical constitution of the body with the heading: “as below, so above, as above, so below”.^i128
 This suggests that a detached observation of the various parts of the body leads to the understanding that they are all of equal nature.
 Once one clearly apprehends their true nature, it becomes evident that there is nothing inherently beautiful in any particular aspect of the body (such as, for example, eyes, hair, and lips).
 In the Therīgāthā, a nun vividly illustrates this insight by pointing out that if one were to turn the body inside out, even one’s mother would be disgusted and unable to bear the smell of it.^i129
	Following the instructions in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, to contemplate the unattractive nature of the body refers in the first instance to one’s own body.^i130
 Realizing the absence of beauty in one’s own body thereby serves in particular as a countermeasure to conceit.^i131
Subsequently, as indicated in the satipaṭṭhāna refrain, the same contemplation is then to be applied “externally”, to the bodies of others.
Such an external application can become a powerful antidote to sensual desire.^i132
 The potential of this contemplation as a countermeasure to sensuality has led to its inclusion in Buddhist ordination ceremonies, part of which consists in instructing a novice monk or nun to contemplate the first five anatomical parts listed in the^pg162 satipaṭṭhāna instruction.
	Despite these benefits, the exercise has possible dangers.
 Excessive contemplation of “impurity” can lead to loathing and repugnance.
 Loathing one’s own body or that of others, however, is only an expression of frustrated desire and does not correspond to the calming of desire intended by the exercise.
 The discourses describe a rather drastic case of excessive and unwise use of this particular meditation practice.
 After the Buddha had instructed a group of monks in this practice and retired into solitude, the monks engaged with such fervour in contemplating the anatomical constitution of their own bodies that they felt thoroughly ashamed and disgusted by it.
 In the end, a substantial number of them committed suicide.^i133
	The need for a balanced attitude is exemplified by the simile in this part of the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, which compares the contemplation of the anatomical parts to examining a bag full of grains and beans.^i134
Just as examining these grains and beans will quite probably not stimulate any affective reaction, so contemplating the anatomical constitution of the body should be carried out with a balanced and detached attitude, so that the effect is to cool desire, not to stimulate aversion.
	If sufficient precautions are taken to establish the appropriate attitude, a wise and balanced contemplation of the unattractiveness of the body has the potential to lead to realization.
 This is documented in the Therīgāthā, which reports two nuns gaining full awakening by contemplating the anatomical constitution of their own bodies.^i135
	Several discourses categorize the whole set of thirty-one anatomical parts listed in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta under the elements earth^pg163 and water in the context of a general exposition of the four elements.^i136
 This indicates that the next exercise in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, where the body is analysed into its four elementary qualities, constitutes a related type of contemplation.
 The instructions for this contemplation are:
	^sutta He reviews this same body, however it is placed, however disposed, as consisting of elements thus:
 “in this body there are the earth element, the water element, the fire element, and the air element”.^i137
	The ancient Indian scheme of four elements, mentioned here, represents four basic qualities of matter: solidity, liquidity (or cohesion), temperature, and motion.^i138
 Since contemplation of the thirty-one anatomical parts has covered mainly the first two of these qualities, solidity and liquidity, the four-element analysis entails a more comprehensive approach, extending awareness to aspects of the body that manifest the qualities of temperature and motion.
 Thus the present exercise further develops the analysis of the body on a more comprehensive and refined level.^i139
	Contemplation of the body’s earthy and watery qualities can be undertaken by observing the physical sensations of the solid and liquid parts of the body.
 Awareness of its fiery quality can be developed through noting variations in bodily temperature, and to some extent also by turning awareness to the processes of digestion and ageing.
 Air, representing the quality of motion, can be covered by directing awareness to the different movements that take place within the organism, such as the circulation of the blood or the cycle of the breaths.^i140
 The same elementary qualities can be combined in a single contemplation, by being aware of these four qualities as characteristics of each part or particle of the body.
	The corresponding simile illustrates the effect of this particular method of contemplation with a butcher who has slaughtered and cut up a cow to sell.
 According to the commentaries, the butcher^pg164 simile indicates a change of cognition (saññā), since after the slaughter the butcher thinks no longer in terms of “cow”, but only in terms of “meat”.^i141
 A similar shift of cognition takes place when a meditator dissects the body into its elementary qualities: the body is no longer experienced as “I” or “mine”, but simply as a combination of these four qualities.
	To experience oneself as a combination of material qualities reveals the qualitative identity of one’s own body with the external environment.^i142
 In this way, a healthy degree of detachment develops, counteracting the grasping at what is, in the end, merely a combination of material qualities.
 With sustained contemplation a meditator may come to realize that this apparently so solid and compact material body, and with it the whole material world, is entirely without essence.^i143
 There are simply different degrees of hardness or softness, of wetness or dryness, of hotness or coldness and some degree of motion (at least on the subatomic level).
 Contemplation of the four elements has thus the potential to lead to a penetrative realization of the insubstantial and selfless nature of material reality.^i144
	The discourses relate the scheme of the four elements not only to the human body, but also to material existence in general.
 The^pg165 Mahāhatthipadopama Sutta takes up the similarity between one’s own “internal” four elements and their “external” counterparts in order to bring home the truth of impermanence.
 The argument is that, since (according to ancient Indian cosmology) at some point in time the whole planet will meet with destruction, what permanence could there be in this insignificant accumulation of the same elements, called “body”?^i145
 Appreciating the impermanent nature of all material phenomena in this way serves to counteract the search for material pleasure.
 Relinquishing desire through disenchantment with material phenomena will then lead to freedom from the bondage caused by the four elements.^i146
	An additional perspective on the four elements can be found in the Mahārāhulovāda Sutta, which uses the four elements as an inspiration for developing the mental qualities of loving kindness (mettā) and compassion (karuṇā).
 Just as the earth is free from resentment, even when various types of refuse are thrown on it, so too a meditator should develop a mind free from resentment.^i147
 Keeping the mind free from resentment in this way, one will be able to react with loving kindness and compassion even in adverse circumstances.^i148
	These passages show that contemplation of the four elements can be employed in a variety of ways, linking the nature of one’s body to the constitution of the whole material environment, or employing these material characteristics in order to develop wholesome mental attitudes.
corpse	^yf7(CORPSE IN DECAY AND MEDITATION ON DEATH)
The last meditation practice among the body contemplations involves some degree of visualization, or at least reflection, since meditators have to compare their own body with what they would ^pg166 see in a charnel ground.^i149
 The instructions for such comparison are:
	^sutta As though he were to see a corpse thrown aside in a charnel ground – one, two, or three days dead, bloated, livid, and oozing matter …
 being devoured by crows, hawks, vultures, dogs, jackals, or various kinds of worms … a skeleton with flesh and blood, held together with sinews …
 a fleshless skeleton smeared with blood, held together with sinews …
 a skeleton without flesh and blood, held together with sinews …
 disconnected bones scattered in all direction… bones bleached white, the colour of shells … bones heaped up, more than a year old … bones rotten and crumbling to dust –
 he compares this same body with it thus: “this body too is of the same nature, it will be like that, it is not exempt from that fate”.^i150
	In ancient India, corpses were apparently left out in the open in such charnel grounds, where they either decayed or were devoured by wild animals.^i151
 The above passage from the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta vividly depicts the ensuing decomposition in nine stages.^i152
 According to Tibetan sources, the Buddha himself contemplated decaying corpses in a charnel ground, when he was still a bodhisatta.^i153
	This exercise highlights two things: the repulsive nature of the body as revealed during the stages of its decay, and the fact that death is the inescapable destiny of all living beings.
 The former links this exercise to the contemplation of the body’s anatomical constitution, serving as an additional tool for counteracting sensual desires.^i154
 This suggestion finds support in the Mahādukkhakkhandha^pg167 Sutta, which employs the same set of terms as a way of contemplating the inherent “disadvantage” (ādīnava) in material bodies.^i155
 Although one might be drawn to dwell on the “advantage” (assāda) of the beautiful bodily aspects of a young member of the opposite sex, the “disadvantage” becomes only too apparent once that same body has succumbed to old age, sickness, and finally to death, at which point this same body, which formerly appeared so attractive, proceeds through the stages of decomposition described above.
 This passage confirms that a central purpose of contemplating a corpse in decay is to counteract sensual desire.
	Following the instructions given in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, the vision or memory of the decomposing body is applied to one’s own body, reflecting that in future one’s own body will undergo the same process of decay.
 This kind of contemplation then also constitutes a means for counteracting conceit.^i156
 Subsequently, as indicated in the “refrain”, the same understanding is then to be applied to the living bodies of others.
 Here, too, the precaution mentioned above in regard to the contemplation of the anatomical constitution applies, namely that the exercise should not lead to aversion or depression.^i157
	The Theragāthā reports the actual practice of this satipaṭṭhāna exercise in a charnel ground.
 Two monks each contemplated a female corpse, but with different results.
 While one monk was able to gain insight, the other was unable to develop the contemplation, since the sight of the body provoked sensual desire in him.^i158
 This danger is also reflected in the commentaries, which caution against the use of a corpse belonging to the opposite sex.^i159
 Yet even though to contemplate a corpse of the opposite sex might not be advisable to a novice meditator, nevertheless, if carried out successfully, one would expect such a contemplation to constitute a particularly powerful antidote to sensuality.^i160
 In fact the Theragāthā also describes^pg168 the case of a monk contemplating a female body while still alive, this being a beautiful girl singing and dancing.^i161
 He was able to put this vision to good use, since by wisely attending to this visual impact he became an arahant.
	An alternative insight to be gained through this meditation practice is the inevitability of death.
 The stages of decay of a dead body vividly depict the truth that whatever one clings to as an embodiment of “I” or “mine” will endure only a limited time.
 Although this seems an obvious implication of this contemplation, the discourses usually describe recollection of death without bringing in the stages of decay.
 The approaches to recollecting death particularly recommended by the Buddha relate to eating and breathing: bringing to mind the fact that even the next mouthful to be eaten and the next breath to be inhaled are not certain to take place.^i162
 Indeed, the presence or absence of breath spells life or death, so mindfulness of breathing also has the potential to be used for recollecting death.
 Whatever approach one may decide to use, recollection of death helps to stir up effort in order to avoid and eradicate unwholesomeness, and can ultimately culminate in realizing the “deathless”.^i163
	Recollection of death also serves as a useful preparation for the time when one actually has to face death.
 As the concluding exercise among the body contemplations, a regular recollection of death can lead to the realization that death is fearful only to the extent to which one identifies with the body.^i164
 With the aid of the body contemplations one can come to realize the true nature of the body and thereby overcome one’s attachment to it.
 Being free from attachment to the body, one will be freed from any fear of physical death.^i165^pg169
feelings	^yg(FEELINGS)
^yg1(CONTEMPLATION OF FEELINGS)
The Pāli term for “feeling” is vedanā, derived from the verb vedeti, which means both “to feel” and “to know”.^i1
In its usage in the discourses, vedanā comprises both bodily and mental feelings.^i2
 Vedanā does not include “emotion” in its range of meaning.^i3
 Although emotions arise depending on the initial input provided by feeling, they are more complex mental phenomena than bare feeling itself and are therefore rather the domain of the next satipaṭṭhāna, contemplation of states of mind.
	The satipaṭṭhāna instructions for contemplation of feelings are:
^sutta When feeling a pleasant feeling, he knows “I feel a pleasant feeling”;
 when feeling an unpleasant feeling, he knows “I feel an unpleasant feeling”;
 when feeling a neutral feeling, he knows “I feel a neutral feeling.”
 When feeling a worldly pleasant feeling, he knows “I feel a worldly pleasant feeling”;
 when feeling an unworldly pleasant feeling, he knows “I feel an unworldly pleasant feeling”;
 when feeling a worldly unpleasant feeling, he knows “I feel a worldly unpleasant feeling”;
 when feeling an unworldly unpleasant feeling, he knows “I feel an unworldly unpleasant feeling”;
 when feeling a worldly neutral feeling, he knows “I feel a worldly neutral feeling”;
 when feeling ^pg170 an unworldly neutral feeling, he knows “I feel an unworldly neutral feeling”.^i4
	The first part of the above instructions distinguishes between three basic kinds of feelings: pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral.
 According to the discourses, developing understanding and detachment in regard to these three feelings has the potential to lead to freedom from dukkha.^i5
 Since such understanding can be gained through the practice of satipaṭṭhāna, ^i6 contemplation of feelings is a meditation practice of considerable potential.
 This potential is based on the simple but ingenious method of directing awareness to the very first stages of the arising of likes and dislikes, by clearly noting whether the present moment’s experience is felt as “pleasant”, or “unpleasant”, or neither.
	Thus to contemplate feelings means quite literally to know how one feels, and this with such immediacy that the light of awareness is present before the onset of reactions, projections, or justifications in regard to how one feels.
 Undertaken in this way, contemplation of feelings will reveal the surprising degree to which one’s attitudes and reactions are based on this initial affective input provided by feelings.
	The systematic development of such immediate knowing will also strengthen one’s more intuitive modes of apperception, in the sense of the ability to get a feel for a situation or another person.
 This ability offers a helpful additional source of information in everyday life, complementing the information gained through more rational modes of observation and consideration.
	In the satipaṭṭhāna instructions, mindfulness of these three feelings is followed by directing awareness to an additional subdivision of feelings into “worldly” (sāmisa) and “unworldly” (nirāmisa).^i7
 According to a passage in the Aṅguttara Nikāya, this sixfold classification represents the range of diversity of feelings.^i8
 Thus with this sixfold scheme, contemplation of feeling comprehensively surveys the whole scale of diversity of the phenomenon “feeling” (cf.  Fig. 7.1 overleaf).^pg171
fig7.1	worldly(sāmisa)
unworldly(nirāmisa)
worldly(sāmisa)
unworldly(nirāmisa)
worldly(sāmisa)
unworldly(nirāmisa)
↑ ↑ ↑↑ ↑↑
pleasant(sukha)
unpleasant(dukkha)
neutral(adukkhamasukha)
^fig7.1(Three and six types of feeling)
	The distinction between worldly (sāmisa) and unworldly (nirāmisa) feelings is concerned with the difference between feelings related to the “flesh” (āmisa) and feelings related to renunciation.^i9
This additional dimension revolves around an evaluation of feeling that is based not on its affective nature, but on the ethical context of its arising.
 The basic point introduced here is awareness of whether a particular feeling is related to progress or regress on the path.
	Unlike his ascetic contemporaries, the Buddha did not categorically reject all pleasant feelings, nor did he categorically recommend unpleasant experiences for their supposedly purifying effect.
 Instead, he placed emphasis on the mental and ethical consequences ^pg172 of all types of feeling.
 With the help of the above sixfold classification, this ethical dimension becomes apparent, uncovering in particular the relation of feelings to the activation of a latent mental tendency (anusaya) towards lust, irritation, or ignorance.^i10
 As the Cūḷavedalla Sutta points out, the arising of these underlying tendencies is mainly related to the three worldly types of feelings, whereas unworldly pleasant or neutral feelings arising during deep concentration, or unworldly unpleasant feelings arising owing to dissatisfaction with one’s spiritual imperfection, do not stimulate these underlying tendencies.^i11
	The conditional relation between feelings and such mental tendencies is of central importance, since by activating these latent tendencies, feelings can lead to the arising of unwholesome mental reactions.
 The same principle underlies the corresponding section of the twelve links of dependent co-arising (paṭicca samuppāda), where feelings form the condition that can lead to the arising of craving (taṇhā).^i12
	This crucially important conditional dependence of craving and mental reactions on feeling probably constitutes the central reason why feelings have become one of the four satipaṭṭhānas.
 In addition, the arising of pleasant or unpleasant feelings is fairly easy to notice, which makes feelings convenient objects of meditation.^i13
	A prominent characteristic of feelings is their ephemeral nature.
 Sustained contemplation of this ephemeral and impermanent nature of feelings can then become a powerful tool for developing disenchantment with them.^i14
 A detached attitude towards feelings, owing to awareness of their impermanent nature, is characteristic of the experiences of an arahant.^i15^pg173
	Another aspect inviting contemplation is the fact that the affective tone of any feeling depends on the type of contact that has caused its arising.^i16
 Once this conditioned nature of feelings is fully apprehended, detachment arises naturally and one’s identification with feelings starts to dissolve.
	A poetic passage in the Vedanā Saṃyutta compares the nature of feelings to winds in the sky coming from different directions.^i17
 Winds may be sometimes warm and sometimes cold, sometimes wet and sometimes dusty.
 Similarly, in this body different types of feelings arise.
 Sometimes they are pleasant, sometimes neutral, and sometimes unpleasant.
 Just as it would be foolish to contend with the vicissitudes of the weather, one need not contend with the vicissitudes of feelings.
 Contemplating in this way, one becomes able to establish a growing degree of inner detachment with regard to feelings.
 A mindful observer of feelings, by the very fact of observation, no longer fully identifies with them and thereby begins to move beyond the conditioning and controlling power of the pleasure–pain dichotomy.^i18
 The task of undermining identification with feelings is also reflected in the commentaries, which point out that to inquire “who feels?” is what leads from merely experiencing feeling to contemplating them as a satipaṭṭhāna. ^i19
	For the sake of providing some additional information about the importance and relevance of contemplation of feelings,
 I will now briefly consider the relation of feelings to the forming of views (diṭṭhi) and opinions, and examine in more detail the three types of feelings presented in the satipaṭṭhāna instructions.^pg174
views	^yg2(FEELINGS AND VIEWS（DIṬṬHI）)
The cultivation of a detached attitude towards feelings is the introductory theme of the Brahmajāla Sutta.
 At the outset of this discourse, the Buddha instructed his monks to be neither elated by praise nor displeased by blame, since either reaction would only upset their mental composure.
 Next, he comprehensively surveyed the epistemological grounds underlying the different views prevalent among ancient Indian philosophers and ascetics.
 By way of conclusion to this survey he pointed out that, having fully understood feelings, he had gone beyond all these views.^i20
	The intriguing feature of the Buddha’s approach is that his analysis focused mainly on the psychological underpinnings of views, rather than on their content.^i21
 Because of this approach, he was able to trace the arising of views to craving (taṇhā), which in turn arises dependent on feeling.^i22
 Conversely, by fully understanding the role of feeling as a link between contact and craving, the view-forming process itself can be transcended.^i23
 The Pāsādika Sutta explicitly presents such transcendence of views as an aim of satipaṭṭhāna contemplation.^i24
 Thus the second satipaṭṭhāna, contemplation of feelings, has an intriguing potential to generate insight into the genesis of views and opinions.^pg175
	Sustained contemplation will reveal the fact that feelings decisively influence and colour subsequent thoughts and reactions.^i25
 In view of this conditioning role of feeling, the supposed supremacy of rational thought over feelings and emotions turns out to be an illusion.^i26
 Logic and thought often serve merely to rationalize already existing likes and dislikes, which in turn are conditioned by the arising of either pleasant or unpleasant feelings.^i27
 The initial stages of the perceptual process, when the first traces of liking and disliking appear, are usually not fully conscious, and their decisive influence on subsequent evaluations often passes undetected.^i28
	Considered from a psychological perspective, feeling provides quick feedback during information processing, as a basis for motivation and action.^i29
 In the early history of human evolution, such rapid feedback evolved as a mechanism for surviving dangerous situations, when a split-second decision between flight or fight had to be made.
 Such decisions are based on the evaluative influence of the first few moments of perceptual appraisal, during which feeling plays a prominent role.
 Outside such dangerous situations, however, in the comparatively safe average living situation in the modern world, this survival function of feelings can sometimes produce inadequate and inappropriate reactions.
	Contemplation of feelings offers an opportunity to bring these evaluative and conditioning functions back into conscious awareness.
 Clear awareness of the conditioning impact of feeling can lead to a restructuring of habitual reaction patterns that have become meaningless or even detrimental.
 In this way, emotions can be deconditioned at their point of origin.^i30
 Without such deconditioning, any affective bias, being the outcome of the initial evaluation triggered by feeling, can find its expression in apparently wellreasoned “objective” opinions and views.
 In contrast, a realistic appraisal of the conditional dependence of views and opinions on the initial evaluative input provided by feeling uncovers the affective attachment underlying personal views and opinions.
 This^pg176 dependency of views and opinions on the first evaluative impact of feeling is a prominent cause of subsequent dogmatic adherence and clinging.^i31
	In ancient India, the Buddha’s analytical approach to views formed a striking contrast to the prevalent philosophical speculations.
 He dealt with views by examining their affective underpinnings.
 For the Buddha, the crucial issue was to uncover the psychological attitude underlying the holding of any view,^i32 since he clearly saw that holding a particular view is often a manifestation of desire and attachment.
	An important aspect of the early Buddhist conception of right view is therefore to have the “right” attitude towards one’s beliefs and views.
 The crucial question here is whether one has developed attachment and clinging to one’s own views,^i33 which often manifests in heated arguments and disputation.^i34
 The more right view can be kept free from attachment and clinging, the better it can unfold its full potential as a pragmatic tool for progress on the path.^i35
 That is, right view as such is never to be given up; in fact, it constitutes the culmination of the path.
 What is to be given up is any attachment or clinging in regard to it.
	In the context of actual meditation practice, the presence of right view finds its expression in a growing degree of detachment and disenchantment with conditioned phenomena, owing to a deepening realization of the truth of dukkha, its cause, its cessation, and the^pg177 way leading to its cessation.
 Such detachment is also reflected in the absence of “desires and discontent”, stipulated in the satipaṭṭhāna “definition”, and in the instruction to avoid “clinging to anything in the world”, mentioned in the satipaṭṭhāna “refrain”.
pleasant	^yg3(PLEASANT FEELING AND THE IMPORTANCE OF JOY)
The conditioning role of pleasant feelings in leading to likes and eventually to dogmatic attachment has some far-reaching implications.
 But this does not mean that all pleasant feelings have simply to be avoided.
 In fact, the realization that pleasant feelings are not simply to be shunned was a direct outcome of the Buddha’s own quest for liberation.
	On the eve of his awakening, the Buddha had exhausted the traditional approaches to realization, without gaining awakening.^i36
While recollecting his past experiences and considering what approach might constitute an alternative, he remembered a time in his early youth when he experienced deep concentration and pleasure, having attained the first absorption (jhāna).^i37
 Reflecting further on this experience, he came to the conclusion that the type of pleasure experienced then was not unwholesome, and therefore not an obstacle to progress.^i38
 The realization that the pleasure of absorption constitutes a wholesome and advisable type of pleasant feeling marked a decisive turning point in his quest.
 Based on this crucial^pg178 understanding, the Buddha was soon able to break through to awakening, which earlier, in spite of considerable concentrative attainments and a variety of ascetic practices, he had been unable to achieve.
	After his awakening, the Buddha declared himself to be one who lived in happiness.^i39
 This statement clearly shows that, unlike some of his ascetic contemporaries, the Buddha was no longer afraid of pleasant feelings.
 As he pointed out, it was precisely the successful eradication of all mental unwholesomeness that caused his happiness and delight.^i40
 In a similar vein, the verses composed by awakened monks and nuns often extol the happiness of freedom gained through the successful practice of the path.^i41
 The presence of delight and non-sensual joy among the awakened disciples of the Buddha often found its expression in poetic descriptions of natural beauty.^i42
 Indeed, the early Buddhist monks delighted in their way of life, as testified by a visiting king who described them as “smiling and cheerful, sincerely joyful and plainly delighting, living at ease and unruffled”.^i43
 This description forms part of a comparison made by the king between the followers of the Buddha and other ascetics, whose demeanour was comparatively gloomy.
 To him, the degree of joy exhibited by the Buddha’s disciples corroborated the appropriateness of the Buddha’s teaching.
 These passages document the significant role of non-sensual joy in the life of the early Buddhist monastic community.
	The skilful development of non-sensual joy and happiness was an outcome of the Buddha’s first-hand realization, which had shown^pg179 him the need to differentiate between wholesome and unwholesome types of pleasure.^i44
 The satipaṭṭhāna instructions for contemplating feelings reflect this wisdom by distinguishing between worldly and unworldly types of pleasant feelings.
	The ingenuity of the Buddha’s approach was not only his ability to discriminate between forms of happiness and pleasure which are to be pursued and those which are to be avoided, but also his skilful harnessing of non-sensual pleasure for the progress along the path to realization.
 Numerous discourses describe the conditional dependence of wisdom and realization on the presence of non-sensual joy and happiness.
 According to these descriptions, based on the presence of delight (pāmojja), joy (pīti) and happiness (sukha) arise and lead in a causal sequence to concentration and realization.
 One discourse compares the dynamics of this causal sequence to the natural course of rain falling on a hilltop, gradually filling the streams and rivers, and finally flowing down to the sea.^i45
 Once non-sensual joy and happiness have arisen, their presence will lead naturally to concentration and realization.^i46
 Conversely, without gladdening the mind when it needs to be gladdened, realization will not be possible.^i47
	The importance of developing non-sensual joy is also reflected in the Araṇavibhaṅga Sutta, where the Buddha encouraged his disciples to find out what really constitutes true happiness and, based on this understanding, to pursue it.^i48
 This passage refers in particular to the experience of absorption, which yields a form of happiness that far surpasses its worldly counterparts.^i49
 Alternatively, non-sensual pleasure can also arise in the context of insight meditation.^i50^pg180
	A close examination of the Kandaraka Sutta brings to light a progressive refinement of non-sensual happiness taking place during the successive stages of the gradual training.
 The first levels of this ascending series are the forms of happiness that arise owing to blamelessness and contentment.
 These in turn lead to the different levels of happiness gained through deep concentration.
 The culmination of the series comes with the supreme happiness of complete freedom through realization.^i51
	The important role of non-sensual joy is also reflected in the Abhidhammic survey of states of mind.
 Out of the entire scheme of one-hundred-and-twenty-one states of mind, the majority are accompanied by mental joy, while only three are associated with mental displeasure.^i52
 This suggests that the Abhidhamma places great emphasis on the role and importance of joy.^i53
 The Abhidhammic scheme of states of mind has moreover kept a special place for the smile of an arahant.^i54
 Somewhat surprisingly, it occurs among a set of so-called “rootless” (ahetu) and “inoperative” (akiriya) states of mind.^pg181
 These states of mind are neither “rooted” in wholesome or unwholesome qualities, nor related to the “operation” of karma.
 Out of this particular group of states of mind, only one is accompanied by joy (somanassahagatā): the smile of the arahant.
 The unique quality of this smile was apparently sufficient ground for the Abhidhamma to allot it a special place within its scheme.
	Extrapolating from the above, the entire scheme of the gradual training can be envisaged as a progressive refinement of joy.
 To balance out this picture, it should be added that progress along the path invariably involves unpleasant experiences as well.
 However, just as the Buddha did not recommend the avoidance of all pleasant feelings, but emphasized their wise understanding and intelligent use, so his position regarding unpleasant feelings and experiences was clearly oriented towards the development of wisdom.
unpleasant	^yg4(UNPLEASANT FEELING)
In the historical context of ancient India, the wise analysis of feeling proposed by the Buddha constituted a middle path between the worldly pursuit of sensual pleasures and ascetic practices of penance and self-mortification.
 A prominent rationale behind the self-mortifications prevalent among ascetics at that time was an absolutist conception of karma.
 Self-inflicted pain, it was believed, brings an immediate experience of the accumulated negative karmic retribution from the past, and thereby accelerates its eradication.^i55
	The Buddha disagreed with such mechanistic theories of karma.
In fact, any attempt to work through the retribution of the entire sum of one’s past unwholesome deeds is bound to fail, because the series of past lives of any individual is without a discernible beginning,^i56 so the amount of karmic retribution to be exhausted is ^pg182 unfathomable.
 Besides, painful feelings can arise from a variety of other causes.^i57
	Although karmic retribution cannot be avoided and will quite probably manifest in one form or another during one’s practice of the path,^i58 awakening is not simply the outcome of mechanically eradicating the accumulated effects of past deeds.
 What awakening requires is the eradication of ignorance (avijjā) through the development of wisdom.^i59
 With the complete penetration of ignorance through insight, arahants go beyond the range of most of their accumulated karmic deeds, apart from those still due to ripen in this present lifetime.^i60
	The Buddha himself, prior to his own awakening, had also taken for granted that painful experiences have purifying effects.^i61
 After abandoning ascetic practices and gaining realization, he knew better.
 The Cūḷadukkhakkhandha Sutta reports the Buddha’s attempt to convince some of his ascetic contemporaries of the fruitlessness of self-inflicted suffering.
 The discussion ended with the Buddha making the ironic point that, in contrast to the painful results of selfmortification, he was able to experience degrees of pleasure vastly ^pg183 superior even to those available to the king of the country.^i62
 Clearly, for the Buddha, realization did not depend on merely enduring painful feelings.^i63
 In fact, considered from the psychological viewpoint, intentional subjection to self-inflicted pain can be an expression of deflected aggression.^i64
	The experience of unpleasant feelings can activate the latent tendency to irritation and lead to attempts to repress or avoid such unpleasant feelings.
 Moreover, aversion to pain can, according to the Buddha’s penetrating analysis, fuel the tendency to seek sensual gratification, since from the unawakened point of view the enjoyment of sensual pleasures appears to be the only escape from pain.^i65
This creates a vicious circle in which, with each experience of feeling, pleasant or unpleasant, the bondage to feeling increases.
	The way out of this vicious circle lies in mindful and sober observation of unpleasant feelings.
 Such non-reactive awareness of pain is a simple but effective method for skilfully handling a painful experience.
 Simply observing physical pain for what it is prevents it from producing mental repercussions.
 Any mental reaction of fear or resistance to pain would only increase the degree of unpleasantness of the painful experience.
 An accomplished meditator might be able to experience solely the physical aspect of an unpleasant feeling without allowing mental reactions to arise.
 Thus meditative skill and insight have an intriguing potential for preventing physical sickness from affecting the mind.^i66
	The discourses relate this ability of preventing physical pain from affecting mental composure to the practice of satipaṭṭhāna in particular.^i67
 In this way, a wise observation of pain through satipaṭṭhāna can transform experiences of pain into occasions for deep insight.^pg184
neutral	^yg5(NEUTRAL FEELING)
While pleasant and unpleasant feelings can activate the respective latent tendencies to lust and irritation, neutral feelings can stimulate the latent tendency to ignorance.^i68
 Ignorance in regard to neutral feelings is to be unaware of the arising and disappearance of neutral feelings, or not to understand the advantage, disadvantage, and escape in relation to neutral feelings.^i69
 As the commentaries point out, awareness of neutral feelings is not an easy task and should best be approached by way of inference, by noting the absence of both pleasant and unpleasant feelings.^i70
	Of further interest in a discussion of neutral feeling is the Abhidhammic analysis of feeling tones arising at the five physical sense doors.
 The Abhidhamma holds that only the sense of touch is accompanied by pain or pleasure, while feelings arising at the other four sense doors are invariably neutral.^i71
 This Abhidhammic presentation offers an intriguing perspective on contemplation of feeling, since it invites an inquiry into the degree to which an experience of delight or displeasure in regard to sight, sound, smell, or taste is simply the outcome of one’s own mental evaluation.
	In addition to this inquiry, a central feature to be contemplated in regard to neutral feelings is their impermanent nature.^i72
 This is of particular importance because, in actual experience, neutral feeling appears easily to be the most stable of the three types of feeling.
Thus to counteract the tendency to regard it as permanent, its impermanent nature needs to be observed.
 Contemplated in this way, neutral feeling will lead to the arising of wisdom, thereby counteracting the latent tendency to ignorance.^pg185
	The Saḷāyatanavibhaṅga Sutta points out that the difference between neutral feelings associated with ignorance and those associated with wisdom is related to whether such feelings transcend their object.^i73
 In the deluded case, neutral feeling is predominantly the result of the bland features of the object, where the lack of effect on the observer results in the absence of pleasant or unpleasant feelings.
 Conversely, neutral feeling related to the presence of wisdom transcends the object, since it results from detachment and equanimity, and not from the pleasant or unpleasant features of the object.
	According to the same discourse, the establishment of such equanimity is the result of a progressive refinement of feelings, during which at first the three types of feelings related to a life of renunciation are used to go beyond their more worldly and sensual counterparts.^i74
 In the next stage, mental joy related to renunciation is used to confront and go beyond difficulties related to renunciation.
 This process of refinement then leads up to equanimous feelings, transcending even non-sensual feelings of mental joy.
 Equanimity and detachment as a culmination of practice also occur in the satipaṭṭhāna refrain for contemplation of feelings, which instructs the meditator to contemplate all kinds of feeling “free from dependencies” and “without clinging”.^i75^pg186
mind	^yh(MIND)
^yh1(CONTEMPLATION OF THE MIND)
During the later part of the previous satipaṭṭhāna, contemplation of feeling, awareness was concerned with the ethical distinction between worldly and unworldly feelings.
 The same distinction occurs at the start of the next satipaṭṭhāna, which directs awareness to the ethical quality of the mind, namely to the presence or absence of lust (rāga), anger (dosa), and delusion (moha).^i1
The instructions are:
	^sutta He knows a lustful mind to be “lustful”, and a mind without lust to be “without lust”;
 he knows an angry mind to be “angry”, and a mind without anger to be “without anger”;
 he knows a deluded mind to be “deluded”, and a mind without delusion to be “without delusion”;
 he knows a contracted mind to be “contracted”, and a distracted mind to be “distracted”;
 he knows a great mind to be “great”, and a narrow mind to be “narrow”;
 he knows a surpassable mind to be “surpassable”, and an unsurpassable mind to be “unsurpassable”;
 he knows a concentrated mind to be “concentrated”, and an unconcentrated mind to be “unconcentrated”;
 he knows a liberated mind to be “liberated”, and an unliberated mind to be “unliberated”.^i2
	Contemplation of the mind makes use of altogether eight categories ^pg187 (cf. Fig. 8.1 below).^i3
 In each case, the task of sati is to know a particular mental quality or its opposite, so that contemplation of the mind actually covers sixteen states of mind.
 The same set of sixteen states appears elsewhere in the discourses in relation to telepathic abilities.^i4
 Thus from the perspective of the discourses this set forms a representative list of states of mind that is relevant both to personal introspection and to assessing another’s mind.
	These sixteen states of mind (or eight categories) can be subdivided into two sets.
 The first set contrasts unwholesome and wholesome states of mind, while the second set is concerned with the presence or absence of higher states of mind.
 I will examine these different states of mind individually, following an introductory assessment of contemplation of the mind in general.
fig8.1	“ordinary” states of mind “higher” states of mind 
lustful (sarāga) great (mahaggata) 
angry (sadosa) unsurpassable (anuttara) 
deluded (samoha) concentrated (samāhita) 
distracted (vikkhitta) liberated (vimutta)
^fig8.1(Eight categories for contemplation of the mind)
	Underlying this satipaṭṭhāna is an implicit shift in emphasis from the ordinary way of experiencing mind as an individual entity to considering mental events as mere objects, analysed in terms of their qualitative characteristics.^i5
 Contemplation of the mind also includes, in accordance with the satipaṭṭhāna “refrain”, awareness of the arising and passing away of the states of mind being contemplated, thereby revealing the momentary character of all mental events.
 In addition, sustained contemplation of the mind will also expose the degree to which what one takes to be one’s own mind is in fact influenced by external conditions.
 In this way, realizing the ^pg188 impermanent and conditioned nature of the mind accords with the general thrust of satipaṭṭhāna towards detachment and nonidentification.
non-reactive	^yh2(NON-REACTIVE AWARENESS OF ONE’S STATE OF MIND)
It is noteworthy that contemplation of the mind does not involve active measures to oppose unwholesome states of mind (such as lust or anger).
 Rather, the task of mindfulness is to remain receptively aware by clearly recognizing the state of mind that underlies a particular train of thoughts or reactions.
 Such uninvolved receptivity is required because of one’s instinctive tendency to ignore whatever contradicts or threatens one’s sense of importance and personal integrity.
 The habit of employing self-deception to maintain one’s self esteem has often become so ingrained that the first step to developing accurate self-awareness is honest acknowledgment of the existence of hidden emotions, motives, and tendencies in the mind, without immediately suppressing them.^i6
 Maintaining non-reactive awareness in this way counters the impulse towards either reaction or suppression contained in unwholesome states of mind, and thereby deactivates their emotional and attentional pull.^i7
	The Vitakkasaṇṭhāna Sutta offers a description of such deactivation: in order to come to grips with the repeated occurrence of unwholesome thoughts, attention turns to the nature of these thoughts and to the volitional disposition or driving force that produced them.^i8
 The discourse explains this simple but ingenious method of turning the full light of attention on the mental condition underlying one’s thoughts with the help of a simile.
 One is walking quite fast for no particular reason.
 Becoming fully aware of what one is doing, one might walk slower, or even stand still, or instead of^pg189 standing one might sit or lie down.
 This progressive increase in physical comfort and tranquillity vividly illustrates how the mental agitation and tension of unwholesome thought processes can be gradually reduced and overcome through direct observation.
 Watching an unwholesome state of mind without involvement in this way will deprive it of its fuel so that it will gradually lose its power.
	Such mindful observation without involvement is illustrated in a simile in the discourses in which the Buddha compared awareness of one’s states of mind to the use of a mirror to see one’s reflection.^i9
 Just as a mirror simply reflects whatever is presented to it, meditators should try to maintain bare awareness of the present condition of their mind without allowing reactions to arise.
	However, the same Vitakkasaṇṭhāna Sutta speaks also of “beating down and crushing mind with mind” as an alternative approach in order to deal with unwholesome thoughts.^i10
 This appears to disagree with the aforementioned.
 But once this instruction is considered in its context, it becomes clear that it comes only as a last resort, after all other alternative approaches, including the above discussed deactivation, have proved ineffective.^i11
 Thus to “beat down and crush mind with mind” is an emergency measure when all else has failed.
 When the situation is about to get out of hand, the use of force will at least prevent the obsessive negative thoughts from spilling over into unwholesome activity. “To beat down and crush mind with mind” is in fact on another occasion counted by the Buddha among those fruitless exercises which he himself had tried and discarded prior to his awakening.^i12
 This goes to show that the use of mere force is not intended for mental development in general, but in cases of emergency only.^pg190
ordinary	^yh3(FOUR “ORDINARY” STATES OF MIND)
Citta, the Pāli term used in this satipaṭṭhāna, usually refers in the discourses to “mind” in the conative and emotional sense, in the sense of one’s mood or state of mind.^i13
	The first three among the states of mind listed in the satipaṭṭhāna instruction are lust (rāga), anger (dosa), and delusion (moha), the three main roots of all unwholesome mental events.^i14
 The basic principle underlying the contemplation of these unwholesome roots, which also underlies the distinction between worldly and unworldly feelings in the previous satipaṭṭhāna, is the clear distinction between what is wholesome and what is unwholesome.
 Systematic development of this ability nurtures an intuitive ethical sensitivity which constitutes an important asset in one’s progress on the path and a reliable guide to proper conduct in daily life.
	The Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta presents each of these “roots” together with its opposite: the absence of lust, anger, or delusion.
 This way of presentation is common in canonical usage, allowing the negative term to cover not only the opposite notion, but also to imply a wider range of meaning.^i15
 Thus to be “without anger”, for example, could refer simply to a state of mind free from irritation, but also to a mind overflowing with loving kindness.
	During meditation, each of these three unwholesome roots can manifest in a distinctive manner:
 the fever of lust may be compared to being on fire within, the physical tension of anger to being overpowered and controlled by a forceful opponent,
 and the confusion of delusion to being hopelessly entangled in a net.^i16
	Taken in an absolute sense, a mind without lust, anger, and delusion is the mind of an arahant.^i17
 This way of understanding is in fact^pg191 the most frequent usage of the qualification “without lust”, “without anger”, and “without delusion” in the discourses.
 Thus contemplation of the mind appears to be not only concerned with momentary states of mind, but also with the overall condition of the mind.
 Understood in this way, to contemplate mind unaffected by lust, anger, or delusion would also include awareness of the degree to which these three unwholesome roots are no longer “rooted” in one’s mental continuum.^i18
	The two states of mind listed next for contemplation, contracted (saṅkhitta) and distracted (vikkhitta), both appear to have negative implications.^i19
 The same two terms occur elsewhere in the discourses, with inward “contraction” being the result of sloth-and-torpor, and external “distraction” the outcome of pursuing sensual pleasures.^i20
 The commentaries on the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta indeed relate the “contracted” state of mind to sloth-and-torpor, while according to them the “distracted” state of mind represents restlessness.^i21
	The ability to balance the mind, by avoiding both contraction and distraction, is an important skill required for the development of deeper levels of concentration or insight.
 The placing of these two states of mind at this point in the instructions for contemplation of the mind indicates the need to cultivate such balance, once one has at least temporarily moved beyond the reach of the grosser types of mental unwholesomeness and is aiming towards the development^pg192 of “higher” states of mind, such as are described in the remainder of this satipaṭṭhāna.
higher state	^yh4(FOUR “HIGHER” STATES OF MIND)
The next qualification, “great” (mahaggata), occurs in other discourses often in the context of calmness meditation, for instance when describing the meditative practice of radiating the four divine abodes (brahmavihāra) in all directions.^i22
 Similarly, in the Anuruddha Sutta “great” represents the ability to pervade a broad area with one’s meditation object, in this case apparently as the result of kasiṇa meditation.^i23
 These instances support the commentarial explanation of this part of the satipaṭṭhāna instructions, according to which a “great” state of mind (mahaggata) is related to the development of absorption.^i24
	The same commentaries relate the next category mentioned for contemplation, the “surpassable” (sa-uttara) state of mind, to the development of concentration.^i25
 “Surpassable”, then, indicates the need to clearly recognize the constituents of a particular level of absorption to be left behind in order to proceed to a higher level of absorption.^i26
 This finds support in the Sekha Sutta, which refers to the fourth absorption as a state of “unsurpassable” equanimity and mindfulness.^i27
 On the other hand, in the discourses the qualification “unsurpassable” frequently occurs in relation to full awakening.^i28
 Understood in this way, the present category also includes the reviewing knowledge after realization, when one investigates the degree to which the mind has been freed from fetters and mental defilements.^pg193
	The next term in the series, the “concentrated” (samāhita) state of mind, is self-explanatory.
 According to the commentaries, this expression includes access concentration and full absorption.^i29
 Since in the discourses samādhi refers to concentration in the context of the development of both calm and insight, the expression “concentrated mind” has a fairly broad range of reference.
	The qualification “liberated” (vimutta) frequently occurs in the discourses in relation to full awakening.^i30
 Understood in this way, the “liberated” mind parallels the more frequent usage of the expression “unsurpassable mind” and also the mind that is forever “without lust”, “without anger”, and “without delusion”, all these referring to the mind of an arahant.^i31
 The commentaries, moreover, relate the qualification “liberated” to temporary freedom from defilements during insight meditation.^i32
 Elsewhere in the discourses the qualification of being “liberated” occurs also in relation to the development of concentration, as “freedom of the mind” (cetovimutti).^i33
 Thus the expression “liberated mind” can be taken to refer to experiences of mental freedom in relation to both calm and insight.
	The theme underlying the contemplation of these four higher states of mind is the ability to monitor the more advanced stages of one’s meditative development.
 In this way, within the scope of contemplation of the mind, sati can range from recognition of the presence of lust or anger to awareness of the most lofty and sublime types of mental experience, each time with the same basic task of calmly noticing what is taking place.
	The emphasis given in this satipaṭṭhāna to mindful contemplation of deep levels of concentration is noteworthy.
 Among the Buddha’s contemporaries, experiences of absorption often gave rise to^pg194 speculative views.^i34
 The Buddha’s distinctive departure from these speculations was his thorough analytical treatment of the meditative absorptions, aimed at understanding their composite and conditioned nature.^i35
 This analytical treatment is exemplified in the Aṭṭhakanāgara Sutta, which states that one should regard the experience of absorption as merely a product of the mind, a conditioned and volitionally produced experience.^i36
 Such understanding then leads to the conclusion that whatever is a product of conditions is also impermanent and subject to cessation.
 Insight into the impermanent nature of deep levels of concentration also forms part of satipaṭṭhāna practice, when the instruction in the “refrain” to contemplate the nature of arising and passing away is applied to the higher states of mind listed for contemplation.^i37
 Undertaken in this way, satipaṭṭhāna in regard to higher states of mind becomes a practical expression of the Buddha’s analytical attitude towards the entire range of mental experience.^pg195
hindrances	^yi(DHAMMAS : THE HINDRANCES)
^yi1(CONTEMPLATION OF DHAMMAS)
The next contemplation in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta is concerned with a specific set of mental qualities, the five hindrances.
 These come as the first among the contemplations of “dhammas”.
 Before embarking on a closer inspection of this exercise, I will examine the implications of the term “dhammas”, in order to provide some background to the exercises listed under this fourth and last satipaṭṭhāna.
	The Pāli term dhamma can assume a variety of meanings, depending on the context in which it occurs.
 Most translators take the term dhammas in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta to mean “mental objects”, in the sense of whatever can become an object of the mind, in contradistinction to the objects of the other five senses.
 In regard to satipaṭṭhāna, however, this rendering appears strange.
 If the term dhammas were to refer to “objects of the mind”, then the other three satipaṭṭhānas should also be included here, since they too can become objects of the mind.
 Moreover, one of the exercises listed under the fourth satipaṭṭhāna is contemplation of the six senses together with their respective objects, so this contemplation of dhammas is not confined to the objects of the mind as the sixth sense only.
 In fact, the dhammas listed in the fourth satipaṭṭhāna, such as the hindrances and the aggregates, etc., do not naturally evoke the classification “mental objects”.^i1^pg196
	What this satipaṭṭhāna is actually concerned with are specific mental qualities (such as the five hindrances and the seven awakening factors), and analyses of experience into specific categories (such as the five aggregates, the six sense-spheres, and the four noble truths).
 These mental factors and categories constitute central aspects of the Buddha’s way of teaching, the Dhamma. ^i2
 These classificatory schemes are not in themselves the objects of meditation, but constitute frameworks or points of reference to be applied during contemplation.
 During actual practice one is to look at whatever is experienced in terms of these dhammas. ^i3
 Thus the dhammas mentioned in this satipaṭṭhāna are not “mental objects”, but are applied to whatever becomes an object of the mind or of any other sense door during contemplation.
	The expression “contemplation of dhammas” occurs also in the Ānāpānasati Sutta in relation to the last four of the sixteen steps for developing mindfulness of breathing, which are concerned with contemplating “impermanence”, “fading away”, “cessation”, and “letting go”.^i4
 At first sight, the four steps described here appear to be ^pg197 quite different from the mental factors and categories listed under contemplation of dhammas in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta.
 The Buddha’s reason for classifying these final four steps of mindfulness of breathing as contemplation of dhammas was that at this more advanced point of practice a meditator will have overcome desires and discontent, thereby becoming established in equanimity.^i5
 The commentaries indicate that this is a reference to the removal of the hindrances.^i6
	Although taking desires and discontent to represent the whole set of the five hindrances is questionable,^i7
 this explanation provides a link between the final four steps of mindfulness of breathing and the sequence of dhammas in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, since these begin with the hindrances.
 According to the commentaries, the hindrances lead the contemplations of dhammas because their removal serves as a basis for developing the comparatively sophisticated contemplations in this last satipaṭṭhāna. ^i8
 A further parallel between the two discourses is that the sixteen-step scheme for mindfulness of breathing leads to the development of the awakening factors,^i9
 since the awakening factors also form part of the contemplation of dhammas in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta.
	These parallels suggest that a temporal progression towards realization could form the key aspect of contemplation of dhammas in both cases.
 In the satipaṭṭhāna context, this progression underlies the sequential order of the mental factors and categories detailed for contemplation of dhammas (cf. Fig. 9.1 below):
 Based on a sufficient degree of mental stability through overcoming the hindrances, contemplation of dhammas proceeds to an analysis of subjective personality, in terms of the five aggregates, and to an analysis of the relation between subjective personality and the outer world, in terms of the six sense-spheres.^i10
 These two analyses form a convenient basis for developing the awakening factors, whose successful establishment constitutes a necessary condition for awakening.
 To ^pg198 awaken is to fully understand the four noble truths “as they really are”, this being the final exercise among the contemplations of dhammas and the successful culmination of satipaṭṭhāna practice.^i11

^fig(9.1 Survey of contemplation of dhammas) 
	With the final four steps of mindfulness of breathing, however, the emphasis is mainly directed towards the insights gained through contemplation of dhammas.
 These proceed from the direct experience of the impermanent nature of phenomena (aniccānupassī), to giving attention to their “fading away” (virāgānupassī) and “cessation” (nirodhānupassī).
 These in turn lead to detachment, or “letting go” (paṭinissaggānupassī): a state of mind fit for awakening.^i12
	Contemplation of dhammas in both the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta and the Ānāpānasati Sutta, then, indicates a temporal progression towards detachment and realization.
 Although the breakthrough to realization can take place while practising any of the sixteen steps of mindfulness of breathing, the final four steps appear to be specifically designed to this end.
 Similarly, although realization can take place while one is engaged in any of the satipaṭṭhāna contemplations, the^pg199 final section of the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, concerned with the contemplation of dhammas, stands out for its particular emphasis on achieving this goal.
	In contrast to the previous satipaṭṭhānas, contemplation of dhammas is particularly concerned with recognizing the conditioned nature of the phenomena under observation.
 In fact, the main instruction for most of the contemplations of dhammas directly mentions conditionality, while in the previous satipaṭṭhānas this happens only in the “refrain”.
 The prominence of conditionality in this satipaṭṭhāna brings to mind the well-known statement that one who sees dependent co-arising sees the Dhamma.^i13
 Such “seeing” (passati) of the Dhamma may well come about through “contemplating” (anu-passati) dhammas, a suggestion which also squares well with the acquisition of the “method” (ñāya) mentioned in the “direct path” assage of the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta as a goal of practice.^i14
	Thus contemplation of dhammas skilfully applies dhammas (classificatory categories) as taught in the Dhamma (the teaching of the Buddha) during contemplation in order to bring about an understanding of the dhamma (principle) of conditionality and lead to the realization of the highest of all dhammas (phenomena): Nibbāna. ^i15
five hindrances	^yi2(CONTEMPLATION OF THE FIVE HINDRANCES)
The first of the contemplations of dhammas is, in a way, a more specific version of contemplation of states of mind, since it turns awareness to five manifestations of the three unwholesome roots: the five hindrances.
 In contrast to the preceding contemplation of the mind, however, contemplation of the hindrances covers not only the presence or absence of a hindrance, but also the conditions underlying the presence or absence of each hindrance.
 In my exploration I will follow the two-stage pattern of this instruction, by focusing initially on the five hindrances and the importance of recognizing them, and considering subsequently the conditions for their presence or absence.
	The satipaṭṭhāna instructions for contemplating the hindrances are:^pg200
^sutta If sensual desire is present in him, he knows “there is sensual desire in me”;
 if sensual desire is not present in him, he knows “there is no sensual desire in me”;
 and he knows how unarisen sensual desire can arise, how arisen sensual desire can be removed, and how a future arising of the removed sensual desire can be prevented.
 If aversion is present in him, he knows.… If sloth-and- torpor is present in him, he knows.… If restlessness-and-worry is present in him, he knows.… If doubt is present in him, he knows “there is doubt in me”; if doubt is not present in him, he knows “there is no doubt in me”; and he knows how unarisen doubt can arise, how arisen doubt can be removed, and how a future arising of the removed doubt can be prevented.^i16
	The use of the term “hindrance” (nīvaraṇa) clearly indicates why these mental qualities have been singled out for special attention:
 they “hinder” the proper functioning of the mind.^i17
 Under the influence of the hindrances one is unable to understand one’s own good or that of others, or to gain concentration or insight.^i18
 Learning to withstand the impact of a hindrance with awareness is therefore an important skill for one’s progress on the path.
 According to the discourses, difficulties in counterbalancing a hindrance are a good reason for approaching an experienced meditator to ask for practical guidance.^i19
	These five hindrances actually cover seven distinct mental qualities.^i20
 That these seven are subsumed under a fivefold presentation is probably due to the similarities in effect and character between sloth (thīna) and torpor (middha), and between restlessness (uddhacca) and worry (kukkucca).^i21
 According to the commentaries, this fivefold presentation makes it possible to correlate each hindrance with^pg201 one of the five mental factors needed to attain absorption (jhānaaṅga).^i22
	The hindrances not only obstruct absorption attainment, they also impede the establishment of the awakening factors (bojjhaṅga).^i23
 This antagonistic relationship between the hindrances and the awakening factors is of considerable importance, since the removal of the former and the development of the latter are necessary conditions for realization.^i24
	Two sets of similes in the discourses depict the specific character and effect of the five hindrances.
 The first set of similes illustrates^pg202 the effect of each hindrance through the image of a bowl filled with water and used as a mirror in order to look at the reflection of one’s face.
 According to these similes, the effect of sensual desire is similar to water mixed with dye;
 aversion resembles water heated to the boil;
 sloth-and-torpor is compared to water overgrown with algae;
 restlessness-and-worry affect the mind like water stirred by wind;
 and doubt is like dark and muddy water.^i25
 In all five cases, one is unable to see one’s reflection properly in the water.
 These similes vividly illustrate the individual character of each hindrance:
 sensual desire colours one’s perception;
 because of aversion one gets heated;
 sloth-and-torpor result in stagnation;
 through restlessness-and-worry one is tossed about;
 and doubt obscures.^i26
	The other set of similes illustrates the absence of the hindrances.
 According to this set, to be free from sensual desire is like being relieved from a debt;
 to be free from aversion is like recovering from physical illness;
 to be unobstructed by sloth-and-torpor is akin to being released from prison;
 to be free from the agitation of restlessness-and-worry is like being liberated from slavery;
 and to overcome doubt resembles crossing a dangerous desert safely.^i27
 This second set of similes provides additional illustrations of the hindrances:
 sensual desire agitating the mind is comparable to being heavily in debt;
 the tension created through aversion is quite literally a dis-ease;
 sloth-and-torpor dulls and imprisons the mind;
 restlessness-and-worry can control the mind to such an extent that one is completely at its mercy;
 and doubt leaves one in a state of insecurity, not knowing which way to turn.
	Since the first set of similes illustrates the presence of the hindrances (in terms of their debilitating effect),
 while the second describes the relief of being free of them, these two sets correspond to the two alternatives for contemplating the hindrances:
 awareness of their presence or of their absence.^pg203
recognizing hindrances	^yi3(THE IMPORTANCE OF RECOGNIZING THE HINDRANCES)
According to the discourses, if a hindrance is present and one does not recognize it, one is “mis-meditating”, a form of practice the Buddha did not approve of.^i28
 But if one does recognize the presence of a hindrance and contemplates it as a satipaṭṭhāna meditation, one’s practice will lead to purification of the mind.^i29
	A passage in the Aṅguttara Nikāya demonstrates the importance of clearly recognizing mental defilements for what they are.
 This discourse reports the monk Anuruddha complaining to his friend Sāriputta that despite concentrative attainments, unshaken energy, and well-established mindfulness, he was unable to break through to full realization.^i30
 In reply, Sāriputta pointed out that Anuruddha’s boasting of concentration attainments was nothing but a manifestation of conceit, his unshaken energy was simply restlessness, and his concern about not yet having awakened was just worry.
 Helped by his friend to recognize these as hindrances, Anuruddha was soon able to overcome them and achieve realization.
	This technique of simple recognition constitutes an ingenious way of turning obstacles to meditation into meditation objects.^i31
 Practised in this way, bare awareness of a hindrance becomes a middle path between suppression and indulgence.^i32
 Several discourses beautifully illustrate the powerful effect of this simple act of recognition by describing how the tempter Māra, who often acts as a personification of the five hindrances, loses his powers as soon as he is recognized.^i33
	The ingenuity of this approach of bare recognition can be illustrated by considering the case of anger from a medical perspective.
 The arising of anger leads to an increase in the release of adrenaline, and such an increase in adrenaline will in turn further stimulate the anger.^i34
 The presence of non-reactive sati puts a brake on this vicious^pg204 cycle.^i35
 By simply remaining receptively aware of a state of anger, neither the physical reaction nor the mental proliferation is given scope.
 If, on the other hand, one abandons the balanced state of awareness and resents or condemns the arisen anger, the act of condemnation becomes just another manifestation of aversion.^i36
 The vicious cycle of anger continues, albeit with a different object.
	Once the hindrances are at least temporarily removed,^i37 the alternative aspect of contemplating the hindrances becomes relevant:
 awareness of their absence.
 In several expositions of the gradual path, such absence of the hindrances forms the starting point for a causal sequence that leads via delight, joy, tranquillity, and happiness (pāmojja, pīti, passaddhi, and sukha) to concentration and the attainment of absorption.
 The instruction in this context is “to contemplate the disappearance of the five hindrances within oneself”.^i38
This suggests a positive act of recognizing and even rejoicing in the absence of the hindrances, which then paves the way for deep concentration.
 Such a conscious act of recognizing and rejoicing in the absence of the hindrances is vividly illustrated in the second set of similes mentioned above, which compare this state of mental freedom to freedom from debt, disease, imprisonment, slavery, and danger.
	Several discourses refer to such a tranquil state of mind, temporarily unaffected by any hindrance or mental defilement, as “luminous”.^i39
 According to a passage in the Aṅguttara Nikāya, to come to know this luminous nature of the mind is in fact an important requirement for the development of the mind (cittabhāvanā).^i40^pg205
conditions for presence	^yi4(CONDITIONS FOR PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF A HINDRANCE)
After the first stage of recognizing the presence or absence of a hindrance, the second stage of the same contemplation follows: awareness of the conditions that have led to the arising of a hindrance, that assist in removing an arisen hindrance, and that prevent future arising of a hindrance (see Fig. 9.2 below).
 The task of sati during this second stage follows a progressive pattern, proceeding from diagnosis, via cure, to prevention.

stage 1 stage 2
^fig9.2(Two stages in the contemplation of the five hindrances)^pg206
	By turning a hindrance into an object of meditation, the mere presence of awareness can often lead to dispelling the hindrance in question.
 Should bare awareness not suffice, more specific antidotes are required.
 In this case, sati has the task of supervising the measures undertaken for removing the hindrance, by providing a clear picture of the actual situation, without however getting involved itself and thereby losing its detached observational vantage point.
	Clearly recognizing the conditions for the arising of a particular hindrance not only forms the basis for its removal, but also leads to an appreciation of the general pattern of its arising.
 Such appreciation lays bare the levels of conditioning and misperceptions that cause the arising of a hindrance, and thereby contributes to preventing its recurrence.
	Sustained observation will reveal the fact that frequently thinking or dwelling on a particular issue produces a corresponding mental inclination, and thus a tendency to get caught up in ever more thoughts and associations along the same lines.^i41
 In the case of sensual desire (kāmacchanda), for example, it will become evident that its arising is due not only to outer objects, but also to an inclination towards sensuality embedded within one’s own mind.^i42
 This sensual tendency influences the way one perceives outer objects and thence leads to the full-blown arising of desire, and various attempts to satisfy this desire.^i43
	The particular dynamic of sensual desire is such that, every time a sensual desire is gratified, the act of gratification fuels ever stronger subsequent manifestations of the same desire.^i44
 With detached observation it will become apparent that gratification of sensual desires is based on a misconception, on searching for pleasure in the wrong place.^i45
 As the Buddha pointed out, the way to inner peace and composure necessarily depends on gaining independence from this vortex of desire and gratification.^i46
	A passage in the Aṅguttara Nikāya offers an intriguing psychological analysis of the underlying causes of sensual desire.
 According to this discourse, the search for satisfaction through a partner of the ^pg207 other gender is related to one’s identification with the characteristics and behaviour of one’s own gender.^i47
 That is, to search for union externally implies that one is still caught up in the limitations of one’s own gender identity.
 This shows that the affective investment inherent in identifying with one’s gender role and behaviour forms an important link in the arising of sensual desire.
 In contrast arahants, who have eradicated even the subtlest traces of identification, are unable to engage in sexual intercourse.^i48
	Just as the arising of sensual desire can be analysed in terms of its psychological underpinnings, so too the absence of sensual desire depends on an intelligent management of the same psychological mechanisms.
 Once one has at least temporarily escaped from the vicious circle of continuous demands for satisfaction, it becomes possible to develop some form of counterbalance in one’s perceptual appraisal.^i49
 If excessively dwelling on aspects of external beauty has led to frequent states of lust, contemplation directed towards the less appealing aspects of the body can lead to a progressive decrease in such states of mind.
	Examples for such counterbalancing can be found among the satipaṭṭhāna meditation practices, in particular the contemplations of the anatomical constitution of the body and of a decaying corpse.
 In addition to these, restraint of the senses, moderation with food, wakefulness, and awareness of the impermanent nature of all mental events are helpful measures in order to prevent the arising of sensual desire.^i50
	Similar approaches are appropriate for the other hindrances, in each case entailing the establishment of some form of counterbalance to the conditions that tend to stimulate the arising of the hindrance.
 In the case of aversion (byāpāda), often the irritating or repulsive feature of phenomena has received undue attention.
 A ^pg208 direct antidote to such one-sided perception is to ignore the negative qualities of whoever is causing one’s irritation, and to pay attention instead to whatever positive qualities can be found in him or her.^i51
 By no longer paying attention to the matter, or by reflecting on the inevitability of karmic retribution, it becomes possible to develop equanimity.^i52
	An important remedy for a tendency to anger and aversion is the development of loving kindness (mettā).^i53
 According to the discourses, developing loving kindness helps to establish harmonious relations not only towards other human beings, but also towards non-human beings.^i54
 In the present context, the concept of “non-human beings” can also be understood in a psychological way, as representing subjective psychological disorders.^i55
 The development of loving kindness indeed counteracts pathological feelings of alienation and low self-esteem, and thereby provides an important foundation for successful insight meditation.
	Loving kindness not only provides the proper preparatory ground for the practice of insight meditation, but it can also directly contribute to realization.^i56
 According to the Buddha, the distinctive^pg209 character of loving kindness meditation as taught by him lies in combining it with the awakening factors, in this way directly harnessing loving kindness to the progress towards realization.^i57
 Several discourses relate the practice of loving kindness in particular to progress from the stage of stream-entry to that of non-returning.^i58
 Clearly, the advantages of developing loving kindness are not confined to its function as an antidote to anger and irritation.^pg210
	Returning to the remaining hindrances, an antidote to sloth (thīna) and torpor (middha) is to develop “clarity of cognition” (ālokasaññā).^i59
 In the discourses and the Vibhaṅga, “clarity of cognition” seems to refer to the development of mental clarity.^i60
 The commentaries take the expression more literally and suggest the use of real light, either from an external source, or else light as an internal mental image.^i61
	Such “clarity of cognition” takes place with the aid of mindfulness and clearly knowing (sampajāna), which brings into play two essential qualities of satipaṭṭhāna as a remedy against sloth-and-torpor.
 This points back to the fact that satipaṭṭhāna itself can at times suffice for countering a hindrance.
 The same is also the case in regard to sensual desire, where contemplation of the anatomical parts or a corpse can act as an antidote.
 Nevertheless, it needs to be kept in mind that the emphasis in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta is not on actively opposing a hindrance, but on clearly recognizing a hindrance together with the conditions related to its presence or absence.
 More active measures are the domain of right effort, another factor of the noble eightfold path.
	The arising of sloth-and-torpor can be caused by discontent, boredom, laziness, drowsiness caused by overeating, and by a depressed state of mind.^i62
 An effective antidote for these can then be found in a sustained application of energy.^i63
 The Aṅguttara Nikāya dedicates an entire discourse to discussing the hindrance torpor, offering a variety of remedies.
 Initially, presumably while still maintaining the formal meditation posture, one can attempt to counter torpor by changing one’s meditation subject, or else by reflecting on or reciting passages from the Buddha’s teachings.
 Should this not work, one can pull one’s ears, massage the body, get up, sprinkle one’s eyes with water and look up at the sky.
 If torpor still persists, walking meditation should be practised.^i64
	In the opposite case, when restlessness (uddhacca) and worry (kukkucca) have arisen, factors leading to an increase of mental calmness and stability should be developed.
 Here, mindfulness of^pg211 breathing stands out as a particularly effective method for calming the thinking activity of the mind.^i65
 In addition, any of the other subjects of calmness meditation are appropriate in this situation, together with improving the general degree of mental calmness and composure during one’s activities.^i66
	According to the discourses, restlessness-and-worry can sometimes arise because of excessive energetic striving.^i67
 Here a less pushy attitude towards one’s practice can help to remedy the situation.
 In relation to restlessness in particular, it is moreover advisable to avoid any provocative talk, since such talk easily leads to prolonged discussions and thereby causes the arising of restlessness.^i68
 The arising of worry is often related to guilt, such as when one has done an unwholesome deed and feels regret about it.^i69
 Thus maintaining an impeccable level of ethical conduct goes a long way in preventing the arising of this hindrance.
 The discourses also relate a monk’s experience of “worry” to lack of clarity concerning the Dhamma, and describe how this was then countered by an instruction or explanation given by the Buddha.^i70
	In the case of the last of the five hindrances, a clear distinction between what is wholesome or skilful and what is unwholesome or unskilful serves to counter the obstruction caused by doubt (vicikicchā).^i71
 This obstruction is of considerable importance, since without clearly knowing what is wholesome and what is unwholesome one will be unable to overcome lust, anger, and delusion.^i72
 The hindrance of doubt plays a role not only in relation to the development^pg212 of insight, but also in the context of calmness meditation.
 This can be inferred from the Upakkilesa Sutta, a discourse concerned mainly with the development of concentration, where doubt heads a list of mental obstructions to the attainment of absorption.^i73
	The ability to distinguish between wholesomeness and unwholesomeness needed for overcoming doubt can be developed with the help of the awakening factor investigation-of-dhammas (dhammavicaya).^i74
 This indicates that from a Buddhist perspective the task of overcoming doubt is not a question of belief or faith.
 Rather, overcoming doubt takes place through a process of investigation, which leads to clarity and understanding.
	Overcoming these five hindrances is a matter of crucial importance for all types of meditative practices.
 For this purpose, the commentaries list a set of factors helpful for overcoming or inhibiting each hindrance, a survey of which can be found in Fig. 9.3 overleaf.
 With increasing meditative proficiency it will become possible to dispel any hindrance as soon as it is recognized, as quickly as a drop of water evaporates when it falls on a hot frying pan.^i75
 The centrally important factor for removing a hindrance, whether slowly or quickly, is sati, since without awareness of the presence or arising of a hindrance, little can be done in terms of prevention or removal.
 This task of mindful recognition is the central theme of contemplation of the hindrances.^pg213

aggregates	^yj(DHAMMAS : THE AGGREGATES)
^yj1(THE FIVE AGGREGATES)
The present satipaṭṭhāna exercise examines the five aggregates which constitute the basic components that make up “oneself”.
 The instructions are:
	^sutta He knows “such is material form, such its arising, such its passing away;
 such is feeling, such its arising, such its passing away;
 such is cognition, such its arising, such its passing away;
 such are volitions, such their arising, such their passing away;
 such is consciousness, such its arising, such its passing away.”^i1
	Underlying the above instructions are two stages of contemplation:
 clear recognition of the nature of each aggregate, followed in each case by awareness of its arising and passing away (cf. Fig. 10.1 below).
 I will first attempt to clarify the range of each aggregate.
 Then I will examine the Buddha’s teaching of anattā within its historical context, in order to investigate the way in which the scheme of the five aggregates can be used as an analysis of subjective experience.
After that I will consider the second stage of practice, which is concerned with the impermanent and conditioned nature of the aggregates.^pg215

stage 1
^fig10.1(Two stages in the contemplation of the five aggregates)
	Clearly recognizing and understanding the five aggregates is of considerable importance, since without fully understanding them and developing detachment from them, it will not be possible to gain complete freedom from dukkha.^i2
 Indeed, detachment and dispassion regarding these five aspects of subjective personality leads directly to realization.^i3
 The discourses, and the verses composed by awakened monks and nuns, record numerous cases where a penetrative understanding of the true nature of the five aggregates culminated in full awakening.^i4
 These instances highlight the outstanding potential of this particular satipaṭṭhāna contemplation.
	These five aggregates are often referred to in the discourses as the “five aggregates of clinging” (pañcupādānakkhandha).^i5
 In this context ^pg216 “aggregate” (khandha) is an umbrella term for all possible instances of each category, whether past, present, or future, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, near or far.^i6
 The qualification “clinging” (upādāna) refers to desire and attachment in regard to these aggregates.^i7
 Such desire and attachment in relation to the aggregates is the root cause for the arising of dukkha. ^i8
	The sequence of these five aggregates leads from the gross physical body to increasingly subtle mental aspects.^i9
 The first of the aggregates, material form (rūpa), is usually defined in the discourses in terms of the four elementary qualities of matter.^i10
 A discourse in the Khandha Saṃyutta explains that material form (rūpa) refers to whatever is affected (ruppati) by external conditions such as cold and heat, hunger and thirst, mosquitoes and snakes, emphasizing^pg217  the subjective experience of rūpa as a central aspect of this aggregate.^i11
	Next in the sequence of the aggregates come feeling (vedanā) and cognition (saññā), which represent the affective and the cognitive aspects of experience.^i12
 In the context of the process of perception, cognition (saññā) is closely related to the arising of feeling, both depending on stimulation through the six senses by way of contact (phassa).^i13
 The standard presentations in the discourses relate feeling to the sense organ, but cognition to the respective sense object.^i14
 This indicates that feelings are predominantly related to the subjective repercussions of an experience, while cognitions are more concerned with the features of the respective external object.
 That is, feelings provide the “how” and cognitions the “what” of experience.
	To speak of a “cognition” of an object refers to the act of identifying raw sensory data with the help of concepts or labels, such as when one sees a coloured object and “re-cognizes” it as yellow, red, or white, etc.^i15
 Cognition to some extent involves the faculty of memory, which furnishes the conceptual labels used for recognition.^i16
	The fourth aggregate comprises volitions (saṅkhārā), representing the conative aspect of the mind.^i17
 These volitions or intentions correspond^pg218  to the reactive or purposive aspect of the mind, that which reacts to things or their potentiality.^i18
 The aggregate of volitions and intentions interacts with each of the aggregates and has a conditioning effect upon them.^i19
 In the subsequent developments of Buddhist philosophy, the meaning of this term expanded until it came to include a wide range of mental factors.^i20
	The fifth aggregate is consciousness (viññāṇa).
 Although at times the discourses use “consciousness” to represent mind in general,^i21 in the context of the aggregate classification it refers to being conscious of something.^i22
 This act of being conscious is most prominently responsible for providing a sense of subjective cohesiveness, for the notion of a substantial “I” behind experience.^i23
 Consciousness ^pg219 depends on the various features of experience supplied by nameand-form (nāmarūpa), just as name-and-form in turn depend on consciousness as their point of reference.^i24
 This conditional interrelationship creates the world of experience, with consciousness being aware of phenomena that are being modified and presented to it by way of name-and-form.^i25
	To provide a practical illustration of the five aggregates: during the present act of reading, for example, consciousness is aware of each word through the physical sense door of the eye.
 Cognition understands the meaning of each word, while feelings are responsible for the affective mood: whether one feels positive, negative, or neutral about this particular piece of information.
 Because of volition one either reads on, or stops to consider a passage in more depth, or even refers to a footnote.
	The discourses describe the characteristic features of these five aggregates with a set of similes.
 These compare material form to the insubstantial nature of a lump of foam carried away by a river; feelings to the impermanent bubbles that form on the surface of water during rain; cognition to the illusory nature of a mirage; volitions to the essenceless nature of a plantain tree (because it has no heartwood); and consciousness to the deceptive performance of a magician.^i26
	This set of similes points to central characteristics that need to be understood with regard to each aggregate.
 In the case of material form, contemplating its unattractive and insubstantial nature corrects mistaken notions of substantiality and beauty.
 Concerning feelings, awareness of their impermanent nature counteracts the tendency to search for pleasure through feelings.
 With regard to cognition, awareness of its deluding activity uncovers the tendency to project one’s own value judgements onto external phenomena as if these were qualities of the outside objects.
 With volitions, insight^pg220 into their selfless nature corrects the mistaken notion that willpower is the expression of a substantial self.
 Regarding consciousness, understanding its deceptive performance counterbalances the sense of cohesiveness and substantiality it tends to give to what in reality is a patchwork of impermanent and conditioned phenomena.
	Owing to the influence of ignorance, these five aggregates are experienced as embodiments of the notion “I am”.
 From the unawakened point of view, the material body is “Where I am”, feelings are “How I am”, cognitions are “What I am” (perceiving), volitions are “Why I am” (acting), and consciousness is “Whereby I am” (experiencing).
 In this way, each aggregate offers its own contribution to enacting the reassuring illusion that “I am”.
	By laying bare these five facets of the notion “I am”, this analysis of subjective personality into aggregates singles out the component parts of the misleading assumption that an independent and unchanging agent inheres in human existence, thereby making possible the arising of insight into the ultimately selfless (anattā) nature of all aspects of experience.^i27
	In order to assess the implications of the aggregate scheme, a brief examination of the teaching of anattā against the background of the philosophical positions in existence in ancient India will be helpful at this point.
historical	^yj2(THE HISTORICAL CONTEXT OF THE TEACHING ON ANATTĀ)
At the time of the Buddha, a variety of differing views about the nature of the self existed.
 The Ājīvika teachings, for example, proposed a soul having a particular colour and considerable size as the true self.^i28
 The Jains posited a finite soul, similarly possessed of size and weight.^i29
 According to them, the soul survived physical death, and in its pure state it possessed infinite knowledge.^i30
 The Upaniṣads proposed an eternal self (ātman), unaffected by the vicissitudes of^pg221 change.
 Upaniṣadic conceptions about such an eternal self ranged from a physical self the size of a thumb abiding in the heart area and leaving the body during sleep, to an unobservable and unknowable self, immaterial, free from death and sorrow, beyond any worldly distinction between subject and object.^i31
 In the Upaniṣadic analysis of subjective experience, this eternal self, autonomous, permanent, and blissful, was taken to be the agent behind all the senses and activities.^i32
	The materialist schools, on the other hand, rejected all immaterial conceptions of a self or soul.
 In order to account for causality, they proposed a theory based on the inherent nature (svabhāva) of material phenomena.^i33
 According to them, a human individual was just an automaton functioning according to the dictates of matter.
 From their perspective, human effort was of no avail and there was no such thing as ethical responsibility.^i34
	In this context, the Buddha’s position cuts a middle path between the belief in an eternal soul and the denial of anything beyond mere matter.
 By affirming karmic consequences and ethical responsibility, the Buddha clearly opposed the teachings of the materialists.^i35
 At the same time, he was able to explain the operation of karmic retribution over several lifetimes with the help of dependent co-arising (paṭicca samuppāda) and thereby without bringing in a substantial unchanging essence.^i36
 He pointed out that the five aggregates, which together account for subjective experience, on closer investigation turn out to be impermanent and not amenable to complete personal control.
 Therefore a permanent and self-sufficient self cannot be found within or apart from the five aggregates.^i37
 In this way, ^pg222 the Buddha’s teaching of anattā denied a permanent and inherently independent self, and at the same time affirmed empirical continuity and ethical responsibility.
empirical self	^yj3(EMPIRICAL SELF AND CONTEMPLATION OF THE AGGREGATES)
Not only does the Buddha’s penetrating analysis of self provide a philosophical refutation of theories proposing a substantial and unchanging self, it also has an intriguing psychological relevance.
“Self”, as an independent and permanent entity, is related to notions of mastery and control.^i38
 Such notions of mastery, permanence, and inherent satisfactoriness to some degree parallel the concepts of “narcissism” and the “ideal ego” in modern psychology.^i39
	These concepts do not refer to articulate philosophical beliefs or ideas, but to unconscious assumptions implicit in one’s way of perceiving and reacting to experience.^i40
 Such assumptions are based on an inflated sense of self-importance, on a sense of self that continuously demands to be gratified and protected against external threats to its omnipotence.
 Contemplating anattā helps to expose these assumptions as mere projections.
	The anattā perspective can show up a broad range of manifestations of such a sense of self.
 According to the standard instructions for contemplating anattā, each of the five aggregates should be considered devoid of “mine”, “I am”, and “my self”.^i41
 This analytical approach covers not only the last-mentioned view of a self, but also the mode of craving and attachment underlying the attribution of “mine” to phenomena and the sense of “I am” as a manifestation of conceit and grasping.^i42
 A clear understanding of the range of each aggregate forms the necessary basis for this investigation.^i43
 Such a^pg223 clear understanding can be gained through satipaṭṭhāna contemplation.
 In this way, contemplation of the five aggregates commends itself for uncovering various patterns of identification and attachment to a sense of self.
	A practical approach to this is to keep inquiring into the notion “I am” or “mine”, that lurks behind experience and activity.^i44
 Once this notion of an agent or owner behind experience has been clearly recognized, the above non-identification strategy can be implemented by considering each aggregate as “not mine, not I, not my self”.
	In this way, contemplation of the five aggregates as a practical application of the anattā strategy can uncover the representational aspects of one’s sense of self, those aspects responsible for the formation of a self image.^i45
 Practically applied in this way, contemplation of anattā can expose the various types of self-image responsible for identifying with and clinging to one’s social position, professional occupation, or personal possessions.
 Moreover, anattā can be employed to reveal erroneous superimpositions on experience, particularly the sense of an autonomous and independent subject reaching out to acquire or reject discrete substantial objects.^i46
	According to the Buddha’s penetrative analysis, patterns of identification and attachment to a sense of self can take altogether twenty different forms, by taking any of the five aggregates to be self, self to be in possession of the aggregate, the aggregate to be inside self, or self to be inside the aggregate.^i47
 The teaching on anattā aims to completely remove all these identifications with, and the corresponding attachments to, a sense of self.
 Such removal proceeds in stages:
 with the realization of stream-entry any notion of a permanent self ^pg224 (sakkāyadiṭṭhi) is eradicated, whilst the subtlest traces of attachment to oneself are removed only with full awakening.
	The teaching of anattā, however, is not directed against what are merely the functional aspects of personal existence, but aims only at the sense of “I am” that commonly arises in relation to it.^i48
 Otherwise an arahant would simply be unable to function in any way.
 This, of course, is not the case, as the Buddha and his arahant disciples were still able to function coherently.^i49
 In fact, they were able to do so with more competence than before their awakening, since they had completely overcome and eradicated all mental defilements and thereby all obstructions to proper mental functioning.
	A well-known simile of relevance in this context is that of a chariot which does not exist as a substantial thing apart from, or in addition to, its various parts.^i50
 Just as the term “chariot” is simply a convention, so the superimposition of “I”-dentifications on experience are nothing but conventions.^i51
 On the other hand, to reject the existence of an independent, substantial chariot does not mean that it is impossible to ride in the conditioned and impermanent functional assemblage of parts to which the concept “chariot” refers.
 Similarly, to deny the existence of a self does not imply a denial of the conditioned and impermanent interaction of the five aggregates.
	Another instance showing the need to distinguish between emptiness and mere nothingness, in the sense of annihilation, occurs in a discourse from the Abyākata Saṃyutta.
 Here, the Buddha, on being directly questioned concerning the existence of a self (attā), refused to give either an affirmative or a negative answer.^i52
 According to his own explanation later on, if he had simply denied the existence of a self, it might have been misunderstood as a form of annihilationism, a position he was always careful to avoid.
 Such a misunderstanding can in fact have dire consequences, since to mistakenly believe that anattā implies there to be nothing at all can lead to wrongly assuming that consequently there is no karmic responsibility.^i53
	In fact, although the scheme of the five aggregates opposes the^pg225 notion of a self and therefore appears essentially negative in character, it also has the positive function of defining the components of subjective empirical existence.^i54
 As a description of empirical personality, the five aggregates thus point to those central aspects of personal experience that need to be understood in order to progress towards realization.^i55
	A breakdown into all five aggregates might not be a matter of absolute necessity, since some passages document less detailed analytical approaches to insight.
 According to the Mahāsakuludāyi Sutta, for example, the simple distinction between body and consciousness constituted a sufficient degree of analysis for several disciples of the Buddha to gain realization.^i56
 Even so, most discourses operate with the more usual analysis of the mental side of experience into four aggregates.
 This more detailed analysis might be due to the fact that it is considerably more difficult to realize the impersonal nature of the mind than of the body.^i57
	Compared with the previous satipaṭṭhāna contemplations of similar phenomena (such as body, feelings, and mind), contemplation of the aggregates stands out for its additional emphasis on exposing identification-patterns.
 Once these patterns of identification are seen for what they really are, the natural result will be disenchantment and detachment in regard to these five aspects of subjective experience.^i58
 A key aspect for understanding the true nature of the aggregates, and thereby of oneself, is awareness of their impermanent and conditioned nature.^pg226
arising	^yj4(ARISING AND PASSING AWAY OF THE AGGREGATES)
According to the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, to contemplate the five aggregates requires a clear recognition of each, followed by directing awareness to their arising (samudaya) and their passing away (atthagama).
 This second stage of practice reveals the impermanent character of the aggregates, and to some extent thereby also points to their conditioned nature.^i59
	In the discourses, contemplation of the impermanent nature of the aggregates, and thereby of oneself, stands out as a particularly prominent cause for gaining realization.^i60
 Probably because of its powerful potential for awakening, the Buddha spoke of this particular contemplation as his “lion’s roar”.^i61
 The reason underlying the eminent position of contemplating the impermanent nature of the aggregates is that it directly counters all conceit and “I”- or “mine”-making.^i62
 The direct experience of the fact that every aspect of oneself is subject to change undermines the basis on which conceit and “I”- or “mine”-making take their stand.
 Conversely, to the extent to which one is no longer under the influence of “I” or “mine” otions in regard to the five aggregates, any change or alteration of the aggregates will not lead to sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair.^i63
 As the Buddha emphatically advised: “give up the aggregates, since none of them is truly your own!”^i64
	In practical terms, contemplating the arising and passing away of each aggregate can be undertaken by observing change taking place in every aspect of one’s personal experience, be these, for example, the cycle of breaths or circulation of the blood, the change of feelings from pleasant to unpleasant, the variety of cognitions and volitional reactions arising in the mind, or the changing nature of consciousness^pg227 , arising at this or that sense door.
 Such practice can then build up to contemplating the arising and passing away of all five aggregates together, when one comprehensively surveys the five aggregate components of any experience and at the same time witnesses the impermanent nature of this experience.
	Contemplating the arising and passing away of the five aggregates also highlights their conditioned nature.
 The interrelatedness of impermanence and conditionality with regard to the five aggregates is practically depicted in a discourse from the Khandha Saṃyutta, in which realization of the impermanent nature of the five aggregates takes place based on understanding of their conditioned nature.^i65
 Since the conditions for the arising of each aggregate are impermanent, this passages points out, how could the conditionally arisen aggregate be permanent?
	Another discourse in the Khandha Saṃyutta relates the arising and passing away of the material aggregate to nutriment, while feelings, cognitions, and volitions depend on contact, and consciousness on name-and-form.^i66
 Dependent on nutriment, contact, and nameand-form, these five aggregates in turn constitute the condition for the arising of pleasant and unpleasant experiences.
 The same discourse points out that against the all too apparent “advantage”
(assāda) of experiencing pleasure through any of the aggregates stands the “disadvantage” (ādīnava) of their impermanent and therefore unsatisfactory nature.
 Thus the only way out (nissaraṇa) is to abandon desire and attachment towards these five aggregates.
	A related viewpoint on “arising” (samudaya) is provided in yet another discourse from the same Khandha Saṃyutta, which points out that delight provides the condition for the future arising of the aggregates, while the absence of delight leads to their cessation.^i67
 This passage links the conditioned and conditioning nature of the aggregates to a comprehension of dependent co-arising.
 In the Mahāhatthipadopama Sutta, such comprehension of dependent co-arising leads to an understanding of the four noble truths.^i68
	From a practical perspective, contemplation of the conditioned and conditioning nature of the five aggregates can be undertaken by ^pg228 becoming aware how any bodily or mental experience depends on, and is affected by, a set of conditions.
 Since these conditions are not amenable to full personal control, one evidently does not have power over the very foundation of one’s own subjective experience.^i69
 “I” and “mine” turn out to be utterly dependent on what is “other”, a predicament which reveals the truth of anattā.
	The one centrally important condition, however, which can be brought under personal control through systematic training of the mind, is identification with the five aggregates.
 This crucial conditioning factor of identification is the central focus of this satipaṭṭhāna contemplation, and its complete removal constitutes the successful completion of the practice.
	According to the discourses, detachment from these constituent parts of one’s personality through contemplating the conditioned and impermanent nature of the aggregates is of such significance that direct knowledge of the arising and passing away of the five aggregates is a sufficient qualification for becoming a stream-enterer.^i70
Not only that, but contemplation of the five aggregates is capable of leading to all stages of awakening, and is still practised even by arahants.^i71
 This vividly demonstrates the central importance of this contemplation, which progressively exposes and undermines self identifications and attachments and thereby becomes a powerful manifestation of the direct path to realization.^pg229
sense spheses	^yk(DHAMMAS : THE SENSE-SPHERES)
^yk1(THE SENSE-SPHERES AND THE FETTERS)
The previous satipaṭṭhāna exercise was concerned with analysing subjective personality with the help of the aggregate scheme.
 An alternative or complementary approach is to turn to the relationship between oneself and the outer world.^i1
This is the topic covered by contemplation of the sense-spheres, which directs awareness to the six “internal” and “external” sense-spheres (ajjhattikabāhira āyatana), and to the fetter arising in dependence on them.
 Here are the instructions for this exercise:
	^sutta He knows the eye, he knows forms, and he knows the fetter that arises dependent on both, and he also knows how an unarisen fetter can arise, how an arisen fetter can be removed, and how a future arising of the removed fetter can be prevented.
He knows the ear, he knows sounds, and he knows the fetter that arises dependent on both, and.… He knows the nose, he knows odours, and he knows the fetter that arises dependent on both, and.…
He knows the tongue, he knows flavours, and he knows the fetter that arises dependent on both, and.… He knows the body, he knows tangibles, and he knows the fetter that arises dependent on both, and.…^pg230
He knows the mind, he knows mind-objects, and he knows the fetter that arises dependent on both, and he also knows how an unarisen fetter can arise, how an arisen fetter can be removed, and how a future arising of the removed fetter can be prevented.^i2
	According to the discourses, to develop understanding and detachment in regard to these six internal and external sense-spheres is of central importance for the progress towards awakening.^i3
 An important aspect of such understanding is to undermine the misleading sense of a substantial “I” as the independent experiencer of sense objects.
 Awareness directed to each of these sense-spheres will reveal that subjective experience is not a compact unit, but rather a compound made up of six distinct “spheres”, each of which is dependently arisen.
	Each of these sense-spheres includes both the sense organ and the sense object.
 Besides the five physical senses (eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body) and their respective objects (sight, sound, smell, flavour, and touch), the mind (mano) is included as the sixth sense, together with its mental objects (dhamma).
 In the present context, “mind” (mano) represents mainly the activity of thought (maññati).^i4
 While the five physical senses do not share each other’s respective field of activity, all of them relate to the mind as the sixth sense.^i5
 That is, all perceptual processes rely to some extent on the interpretative role of the mind, since it is the mind which “makes sense” out of the other senses.
 This shows that the early Buddhist scheme of six sensespheres does not set pure sense perception against the conceptual activity of the mind, but considers both as interrelated processes, which together bring forth the subjective experience of the world.
	It is particularly intriguing that early Buddhism treats the mind just like the other sense organs.
 Thought, reasoning, memory, and reflection are dealt with in the same manner as the sense data of any other sense door.
 Thus the thinking activity of the mind shares the impersonal status of external phenomena perceived through the five senses.^pg231
	Insight into this impersonal character of “one’s own” thoughts can be gained even with the first few attempts at meditation, when one discovers how difficult it is to avoid getting lost in all kinds of reflections, daydreams, memories, and fantasies, despite being determined to focus on a particular object of meditation.
 Just as it is impossible only to see, hear, smell, taste, and touch what is wished for, so too, with an untrained mind, it is not possible to have thoughts only when and how one would like to have them.
 For precisely this reason a central purpose of meditative training is to remedy this situation by gradually taming the thinking activity of the mind and bringing it more under conscious control.^i6
	The above passage from the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta lists both the sense organs and sense objects for contemplation.
 On the face of it, the instruction to “know” (pajānāti) eye and forms, ear and sounds, etc. seems rather flat, but on further consideration this instruction may reveal some deeper implications.
	Often these six senses and their objects occur in descriptions of the conditioned arising of consciousness (viññāṇa).^i7
 An intriguing aspect of this conditional situation is the role that subjective influence plays in the perceptual process.
 Experience, represented by the six types of consciousness, is the outcome of two determinant influences: the “objective” aspect on the one hand, that is, the in-coming sensory impressions; and the “subjective” aspect on the other hand, namely, the way in which these sense impressions are received and cognized.^i8
 Supposedly objective perceptual appraisal is in reality conditioned by the subject as much as by the object.^i9
 One’s experience^pg232  of the world is the product of an interaction between the “subjective” influence exercised by how one perceives the world, and the “objective” influence exercised by the various phenomena of the external world.
	Understood in this way, the fact that the satipaṭṭhāna instruction directs awareness to each sense organ could have deeper implications, in the sense of pointing to the need to recognize the subjective bias inherent in each process of perception.
 The influence of this subjective bias has a decisive effect on the first stages of perception and can lead to the arising of a fetter (saṃyojana).
 Such subsequent reactions are often based on qualities and attributes assumed to belong to the perceived object.
 In actual fact, these qualities and attributes are often projected on the object by the perceiver.
	Satipaṭṭhāna contemplation of the six sense-spheres can lead to recognizing this influence of personal biases and tendencies on the process of perception.
 Contemplating in this way will uncover the root cause for the arising of unwholesome mental reactions.
 This reactive aspect forms in fact part of the above instructions, where the task of sati is to observe the fetter that can arise in dependence on sense and object.
	Although a fetter arises in dependence on sense and object, the binding force of such a fetter should not be attributed to the senses or objects per se.
 The discourses illustrate this with the example of two bulls, bound together by a yoke.
 Just as their bondage is not caused by either of the bulls, but by the yoke, so too the fetter should not be imputed to either its inner or its outer conditions (for example eye and forms), but to the binding force of desire.^i10
	In the discourses there is considerable variation in the usage of the term “fetter”,^i11 which suggests that to speak of “fetters” does not always necessarily refer to a fixed set, but may sometimes include whatever falls under the same principle, in the sense of fettering and causing bondage.
 The most common presentation of “fetters” in the discourses lists altogether ten types: belief in a substantial and permanent self, doubt, dogmatic clinging to particular rules and^pg233 observances, sensual desire, aversion, craving for fine-material existence, craving for immaterial existence, conceit, restlessness, and ignorance.^i12
	The eradication of these ten fetters takes place with the different stages of realization.^i13
 Since all these ten fetters might not necessarily manifest in the context of actual satipaṭṭhāna practice, and since the term “fetter” has a certain breadth of meaning in the discourses, during contemplation of the sense-spheres awareness can be directed in particular to the fettering force of desire and aversion in regard to whatever is experienced.
	The pattern of a fetter’s arising proceeds from what has been perceived, via various thoughts and considerations, to the manifestation ^pg234 of desire and thereby to bondage.^i14
 A mindful observation of the conditions that lead to the arising of a fetter constitutes the second stage of contemplation of the sense-spheres (cf. Fig. 11.1 below).
 The task of awareness in this case, paralleling contemplation of the hindrances, is non-reactive observation.
 Such non-reactive observation is directed towards individual instances in which perception causes desire and bondage, and also towards discovering the general patterns of one’s mental inclinations, in order to be able to prevent the future arising of a fetter.

stage 1 stage 2
^fig11.1 (wo stages in the contemplation of the six sense-spheres)
	As with the contemplation of the hindrances, the second stage of contemplation of the sense-spheres (concerned with the arising and removal of a fetter) follows a progressive pattern from diagnosis, via cure, to prevention.
 In contrast to the contemplation of the hindrances, however, contemplation of the sense-spheres places a stronger emphasis on the perceptual process.
 This constitutes an additional degree of refinement, since attention is here directed to the first stages of the perceptual process, which, if left unattended, can lead to the arising of unwholesome mental reactions.
	To fill in some background to this aspect of satipaṭṭhāna, I will briefly survey the Buddha’s analysis of the perceptual process, with particular attention to the implications of the “latent tendencies” ^pg235 (anusaya) and “influxes” (āsava), and also to restraint at the sense doors.
 This will provide the necessary basis for evaluating the early Buddhist approach to “cognitive training”, and for examining the Buddha’s pithy instruction to the ascetic Bāhiya that led to his immediate full awakening.
perceptual	^yk2(THE PERCEPTUAL PROCESS)
The conditioned character of the perceptual process is a central aspect of the Buddha’s analysis of experience.
 According to the Madhupiṇḍika Sutta, the conditional sequence of the average perceptual process leads from contact (phassa) via feeling (vedanā) and cognition (saññā) to thought (vitakka),
 which can in turn stimulate conceptual proliferation (papañca).^i15
 Such conceptual proliferations tend to give rise to further concoctions of proliferations and cognitions (papañcasaññāsaṅkhā),
 which lead from the originally perceived sense data to all kinds of associations concerning past, present, and future.
	The Pāli verb forms employed in this passage from the Madhupiṇḍika Sutta indicate that the last stage of this perceptual process is an event of which one is the passive experiencer.^i16
 Once the conditioned sequence of the perceptual process has reached the stage of conceptual proliferation one becomes, as it were, a victim of one’s own associations and thoughts.
 The thought process proliferates, weaving a net built from thoughts, projections, and associations, of which the “thinker” has become almost a helpless prey.
	The crucial stage in this sequence, where the subjective bias can set in and distort the perceptual process, occurs with the initial appraisal of feeling (vedanā) and cognition (saññā).
 Initial distortions of the sense data arising at this stage will receive further reinforcement by thinking and by conceptual proliferation.^i17
 Once the stage of conceptual proliferation is reached, the course is set.
 The proliferations are projected back onto the sense data and the mind continues proliferating by interpreting experience in line with the original biased cognition.
 The stages of cognition and initial conceptual reaction are therefore decisive aspects of this conditioned sequence.^pg236
	The perceptual sequence described in the Madhupiṇḍika Sutta occurs in an elucidation of a short statement made by the Buddha,
 in which he related his teaching to the dispelling of various latent (anuseti) types of cognitions (saññā), and to overcoming the “latent tendencies” (anusaya) that can come into operation during the process of perception.^i18
	The discourses mention various types of latent tendencies.
 A commonly occurring set of seven includes sensual desire, irritation, views, doubt, conceit, craving for existence, and ignorance.^i19
 The central characteristic of a latent tendency is unconscious activation.
 As the verb anuseti, “to lie along with”, suggests, a latent tendency lies dormant in the mind, but can become activated during the process of perception.
 In their dormant stage, the underlying tendencies are already present in newborn babies.^i20
	A term of similar importance in relation to the process of perception is influx (āsava).^i21
 These influxes can “flow” (āsavati) into and thereby “influence” the perceptual process.^i22
 As with the underlying tendencies, this influence operates without conscious intention.
 The influxes arise owing to unwise attention (ayoniso manasikāra) and to ignorance (avijjā).^i23
 To counteract and prevent the arising of the influxes is the central aim of the monastic training rules laid^pg237 down by the Buddha,^i24 and their successful eradication (ā-savakkhaya) is a synonym for full awakening.^i25
	The discourses often mention three types of influx: the influx of sensual desire, desire for existence, and ignorance.^i26
 Sensual desire and desire for existence come up also in the second noble truth as main factors in the arising of dukkha,^i27
 while ignorance forms the starting point of the “twelve links” depicting the “dependent coarising” (paṭicca samuppāda) of dukkha.
 These occurrences indicate that the scheme of the influxes is intrinsically related to the causes for the arising of dukkha.^i28
 That is, desire for sensual enjoyment, desire for becoming this or that, and the deluding force of ignorance, are those “influences” responsible for the genesis of dukkha.
	The whole purpose of practising the path taught by the Buddha is to eradicate the influxes (āsava), uproot the latent tendencies (anusaya), and abandon the fetters (saṃyojana).^i29
 These three terms refer to the same basic problem from slightly different perspectives, namely to the arising of craving (taṇhā) and related forms of unwholesomeness in relation to any of the six sense-spheres.^i30
 In this context, the influxes represent root causes for the arising of dukkha that might “flow into” perceptual appraisal, the underlying tendencies are those unwholesome inclinations in the unawakened mind^pg238 that “tend” to get triggered off during the perceptual process, and the fetters arising at any sense door are responsible for “binding” beings to continued transmigration in saṃsāra.
	A way to avoid the operation of the influxes, underlying tendencies, and fetters, and thereby the arising of unwholesome states of mind and reactions at any sense door, is the practice of senserestraint (indriya saṃvara).
 The method of sense-restraint is mainly based on sati, whose presence exerts a restraining influence on the reactions and proliferations that otherwise tend to occur during the perceptual process.^i31
 As the discourses point out, sense-restraint causes the arising of joy and happiness, which in turn form the basis for concentration and insight.^i32
 Indeed, living with full awareness in the present moment, free from sensual distraction, can give rise to an exquisite sense of delight.
	Such cultivation of mindfulness at the sense doors does not imply that one is simply to avoid sense impressions.
 As the Buddha pointed out in the Indriyabhāvanā Sutta, if simply avoiding seeing and hearing were in itself conducive to realization, blind and deaf people would be accomplished practitioners.^i33
 Instead, the instruction for sense-restraint enjoins the practitioner not to dwell on the sign (nimitta) or secondary characteristics (anuvyañjana) of sense objects, in order to avoid the “flowing in” of detrimental influences.^i34
 In the present context, “sign” (nimitta) refers to the distinguishing feature by which one recognizes or remembers something.^i35
 In regard to the process of perception, this “sign” (nimitta) is related to the first evaluation of the raw sense data, because of^pg239 which the object appears to be, for example, “beautiful” (subhanimitta) or “irritating” (paṭighanimitta), which then usually leads to subsequent evaluations and mental reactions.^i36
	The instruction to bring restraint to bear on the secondary characteristics (anuvyañjana) could correspond to further associations in the perceptual process, which elaborate in detail the initial biased cognition (saññā).^i37
 The tendency to biased and affective reactions is rooted in the stage of sign making, when the first barely conscious evaluations that might underlie cognition (saññā) can arise.
 In the context of the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta’s injunction to contemplate the causes related to the arising of a fetter, this stage of sign making is especially relevant.
 It is this stage, therefore, and the possibilities of influencing it, to which I will now turn in more detail.
cognitive	^yk3(COGNITIVE TRAINING)
According to the discourses, a penetrative understanding of the nature of cognition (saññā) is a prominent cause for realization.^i38
 Cognitions under the influence of sensuality or aversion lead to cognitive distortions and thereby cause the arising of unwholesome thoughts and intentions.^i39
 Distorted or biased cognitions include significant misapprehensions of reality that affect the fundamental structure of ordinary experience, such as when one wrongly perceives permanence, satisfaction, substantiality, and beauty in what^pg240 in fact is the opposite.^i40
 The presence of such unrealistic elements within cognition is due to the habitual projection of one’s own mistaken notions onto cognized sense data, a process of which one is usually unaware.
 These habitual projections underlying the perceptual process are responsible for unrealistic expectations and thereby for frustration and conflict.^i41
	As a countermeasure to these unrealistic cognitive appraisals, the discourses recommend cultivating beneficial cognitions.^i42
 Such beneficial cognitions direct awareness to the impermanence or unsatisfactoriness of all aspects of experience.
 Others are concerned with more specific issues, such as the unattractive features of the body or food.
 Regarding the nature of these cognitions, an important point to bear in mind is that to cognize something as beautiful or as impermanent does not refer to a process of reflection or consideration, but only to being aware of a particular feature of an object, in other words, to experience it from a particular point of view.
 In the case of ordinary cognitive appraisal, this point of view or act of selection is usually not at all conscious.
 Cognizing someone or something as beautiful often takes place as the combined outcome of past conditioning and one’s present mental inclinations.
 These tend to determine which aspect of an object becomes prominent during cognition.
 Reflective thought only subsequently enters into the scene, influenced by the kind of cognition that has led to its arising.^i43
	The crucial point, from a meditative perspective, is that cognitions are amenable to a process of training.^i44
 The ability to train cognitions^pg241 is related to the fact that cognitions are the outcome of mental habits.
 By way of cognitive training, one can establish new and different habits and thereby gradually alter one’s cognitions.
 The basic procedure for such cognitive training is related to the same habit-forming mechanism, namely to becoming accustomed to, and familiar with, a certain way of viewing experience.^i45
 By directing awareness again and again to the true characteristics of conditioned existence, these will become more and more familiar, imprint themselves onto one’s way of viewing experience, and thereby lead to the arising of similar ways of cognizing on future occasions.
	The method through which cognition is trained can be conveniently exemplified with a set of terms occurring in the Girimānanda Sutta, where reflection (paṭisañcikkhati) and contemplation (anupassanā) are mentioned alongside cognition (saññā).^i46
 Although this is not spelled out in the discourse, this passage lists those two activities that are related to training cognition: a preliminary degree of wise reflection as a basis for the sustained practice of contemplation (anupassanā).
 Skilfully combined, these two can gradually transform the way the world is cognized.
	To give a practical example: if, on the basis of an intellectual appreciation of impermanence, one regularly contemplates the arising and passing away of phenomena, the result will be the arising of aniccasaññā, of cognitions apprehending phenomena from the viewpoint of impermanence.
 With continued practice, awareness of impermanence will become increasingly spontaneous and have an increasing influence on one’s daily experiences, outside of actual contemplation.
 In this way, sustained contemplation can lead to a gradual change in the operational mechanics of cognition, and in one’s outlook on the world.
	According to the discourses, such cognitive training can lead to a stage at which one is able at will to cognize phenomena as agreeable (appaṭikkūla) or as disagreeable (paṭikkūla).^i47
 The culmination of training one’s cognitions in this way is reached when one completely transcends such evaluations and becomes firmly established in perceptual equanimity.
 The discourses go so far as to consider^pg242 such mastery over one’s cognitions to be superior even to supernatural powers like walking on water or flying through the air.^i48
	The basis for developing such intriguing kinds of mastery is satipaṭṭhāna contemplation.^i49
 The presence of sati directly counteracts automatic and unconscious ways of reacting that are so typical of habits.
 By directing sati to the early stages of the perceptual process, one can train cognition and thereby reshape habitual patterns.
Of central importance in this context is the receptive quality of mindfulness, which gives full attention to the cognized data.
 Of equal significance is sati’s detached quality, which avoids immediate reactions.
	In this way, receptive and detached sati applied to the early stages of the perceptual process can make habitual reactions conscious and enable an assessment of the extent to which one is reacting automatically and without conscious deliberation.
 This also reveals the selective and filtering mechanisms of perception, highlighting the extent to which subjective experience mirrors one’s hitherto unconscious assumptions.
 In this manner, through satipaṭṭhāna contemplation, it becomes possible to access and redress a central cause of the arising of unwholesome cognitions, and thereby for the activation of influxes (āsava), underlying tendencies (anusaya), and fetters (saṃyojana), by de-automatizing or deconditioning habits and subconscious evaluations.
	A practical application of this skill is the subject of the final section of my exploration of the contemplation of the sense-spheres.
bahiya	^yk4(THE INSTRUCTION TO BĀHIYA)
“Bāhiya of the Bark-Garment” was a non-Buddhist ascetic who once approached the Buddha for instructions while the latter was collecting almsfood.
 Still out on the roads of the city, the Buddha gave him a short instruction concerned with cognitive training, with the^pg243 result that Bāhiya immediately gained full awakening.^i50
 The Buddha’s cryptic instruction was:
	^sutta When in the seen will be only what is seen, in the heard only what is heard, in the sensed only what is sensed, in the known only what is known, you will not be by that;
 when you are not by that, you will not be therein;
 when you are not therein, you will be neither here, nor there, nor in between.
 This is the end of dukkha. ^i51
	This instruction directs bare awareness to whatever is seen, heard, sensed, or cognized.
 Maintaining bare awareness in this way prevents the mind evaluating and proliferating the raw data of sense perception.
 This corresponds to an interception of the first stages in the sequence of the perceptual process, through mindful attention.
 Here, bare awareness simply registers whatever arises at a sense door without giving rise to biased forms of cognition and to unwholesome thoughts and associations.^i52
 In terms of sense-restraint, the stage of making a “sign” (nimitta) is thereby brought into conscious awareness.^i53
 Establishing bare awareness at this stage of the perceptual process prevents the latent tendencies (anusaya), influxes (āsava), and fetters (saṃyojana) from arising.^pg244
	The activities of seeing, hearing, sensing, and knowing mentioned in the Bāhiya instruction occur also in the Mūlapariyāya Sutta.^i54
 This discourse contrasts the arahant’s direct comprehension of phenomena with the ordinary way of perception through misconceiving the cognized data in various ways.
 The Chabbisodhana Sutta relates the elaborations absent from what is seen, heard, sensed, and known by an arahant to freedom from attraction and rejection.^i55
 Other passages discuss the same set of activities with an additional emphasis on avoiding any form of identification.^i56
 This injunction is particularly pertinent, since according to the Alagaddūpama Sutta the activities of seeing, hearing, sensing, and knowing can lead to wrongly developing a sense of self.^i57
 Passages in the Upaniṣads indeed take these activities as evidence for the perceiving activity of a self.^i58
	According to the Bāhiya instruction, by maintaining bare sati at all sense doors one will not be “by that”,
 which suggests not being carried away by the conditioned sequence of the perceptual process, thereby not modifying experience through subjective biases and distorted cognitions.^i59
 Not being carried away, one is not “therein” y way of subjective participation and identification.^i60
 Such absence of being “therein” draws attention to a key aspect of the instruction to Bāhiya, to the realization of anattā as the absence of a perceiving self.^pg245
	Neither being “by that” nor “therein” also constitutes a comparatively advanced stage of satipaṭṭhāna practice, when the meditator has become able to continuously maintain bare awareness at all sense doors,
 thereby not being “by that” by remaining free from “clinging to anything in the world”, nor being “therein” by continuing to “abide independently”, as stipulated in the satipaṭṭhāna “refrain”.
	According to the final part of the Bāhiya instruction, by maintaining awareness in the above manner one will not be established “here” or “there” or “in between”.
 A way of understanding “here” nd “there” is to take them as representing the subject (senses) and the respective objects, with “in between” standing for the conditioned arising of consciousness.^i61
 According to a discourse from the Aṅguttara Nikāya, it is the “seamstress” craving (taṇhā) which “stitches” consciousness (“the middle”) to the senses and their objects (the two opposite ends).^i62
 Applying this imagery to the Bāhiya instruction, in the absence of craving these three conditions for perceptual contact do not get sufficiently “tied” together, so to speak, for further proliferations to occur.
 Such absence of unnecessary proliferation is characteristic of the cognitions of arahants, who are no longer influenced by subjective biases and who cognize phenomena without self-reference.
 Free from craving and proliferations, they are not identified with either “here” (senses), or “there” (objects), or “in between” (consciousness), resulting in freedom from any type of becoming, whether it be “here”, or “there”, or “in between”.^pg246
bhojjanga	^yl(DHAMMAS : THE AWAKENING FACTORS)
^yl1(CONTEMPLATION OF THE AWAKENING FACTORS)
The mental qualities that form the topic of the next contemplation of dhammas provide the conditions conducive to awakening, which is why they are termed “awakening factors”.^i1
Just as a river inclines and flows towards the ocean, so the awakening factors incline towards Nibbāna. ^i2
The instructions for contemplating the awakening factors are:
	^sutta If the mindfulness awakening factor is present in him, he knows “there is the mindfulness awakening factor in me”;
 if the mindfulness awakening factor is not present in him, he knows “there is no mindfulness awakening factor in me”;
 he knows how the unarisen mindfulness awakening factor can arise, and how the arisen mindfulness awakening factor can be perfected by development.
If the investigation-of-dhammas awakening factor is present in him, he knows.… If the energy awakening factor is present in him, he knows.… If the joy awakening factor is present in him, he knows.…
If the tranquillity awakening factor is present in him, he knows.… If the concentration awakening factor is present in him, he knows.…
If the equanimity awakening factor is present in him, he knows “there is the equanimity awakening factor in me”;
 if the equanimity^pg247 awakening factor is not present in him, he knows “there is no equanimity awakening factor in me”;
 he knows how the unarisen equanimity awakening factor can arise, and how the arisen equanimity awakening factor can be perfected by development.^i3
	Contemplation of the awakening factors proceeds similarly to the contemplation of the hindrances: first awareness turns to the presence or absence of the mental quality in question, and then to the conditions for its presence or absence (cf.  Fig. 12.1 below).
 However, while in the case of contemplating the hindrances awareness is concerned with the conditions for their abandoning and future nonarising, with the awakening factors the task is to know how to develop and firmly establish these beneficial mental qualities.

stage 1 stage 2
^fig12.1(Two stages in the contemplation of the seven awakening factors)
	Like the contemplation of the hindrances, the instructions for contemplating the awakening factors do not mention any active endeavour to set up or maintain a particular awakening factor, apart from the task of setting up awareness.
 However, just as the mere presence of sati can counter a hindrance, so the presence of sati can promote the arising of the other awakening factors.
 In fact, according to the Ānāpānasati Sutta the seven awakening factors form a conditionally related sequence, with sati as its initial cause and foundation.^i4
This suggests that the development of the awakening factors is a natural outcome of practising satipaṭṭhāna.^i5^pg248
	Besides providing the foundation for the other factors, sati is moreover the one awakening factor whose development is beneficial at any time and on all occasions.^i6
 The remaining six factors can be split into two groups of three: investigation-of-dhammas (dhammavicaya), energy (viriya), and joy (pīti) are particularly appropriate when the mind is sluggish and deficient in energy, while tranquillity (passaddhi), concentration (samādhi), and equanimity (upekkhā) are suitable for those occasions when the mind is excited and over-energetic.^i7
sequence	^yl2(THE CONDITIONAL SEQUENCE OF THE AWAKENING FACTORS)
In the conditional sequence of the awakening factors, “investigation-of-dhammas” (dhammavicaya) develops out of well-established mindfulness.
 Such investigation-of-dhammas seems to combine two aspects: on the one hand an inquiry into the nature of experience (by taking “dhammas” to stand for “phenomena”), and on the other a correlation of this experience with the teachings of the Buddha (the “Dhamma”).^i8
 This twofold character also underlies the word “investigation” (vicaya), derived from the verb vicinati, whose range of meaning includes both “investigating” and “discriminating”.^i9
 Thus “investigation-of-dhammas” can be understood as an investigation of subjective experience based on the discrimination gained through familiarity with the Dhamma.
 Such discrimination refers in particular to the ability to distinguish between what is wholesome or skilful for progress on the path, and what is unwholesome or unskilful.^i10
 This directly contrasts investigation-of-dhammas with the^pg249 hindrance doubt (vicikicchā), which arises owing to lack of clarity about what is wholesome and what is unwholesome.^i11
	The development of investigation-of-dhammas in turn arouses the awakening factor of energy (viriya).^i12
 The arising of such “energy” is related to putting forth effort.^i13
 The discourses further qualify such energy with the attribute “unshaken”.^i14
 This qualification draws attention to the need for effort or energy to be applied with continuity, a specification which parallels the quality of being diligent (ātāpī) mentioned in the “definition” part of the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta.
According to the discourses, energy can manifest either mentally or physically.^i15
 As an awakening factor, energy stands in direct opposition to the hindrance sloth-and-torpor (thīnamiddha).^i16
	In the sequence of the awakening factors, energy in turn leads to the arising of joy (pīti).
 Joy as an awakening factor is clearly a non-sensual type of joy, such as the joy that can be experienced during absorption attainment.^i17
 The progression of the awakening factors then leads from joy (pīti), via tranquillity (passaddhi), to concentration (samādhi).
 This echoes a causal sequence often described elsewhere in the discourses, which similarly proceeds from joy, tranquillity, and happiness to concentration, and culminates with the arising of wisdom and realization.^i18^pg250
	As an awakening factor, tranquillity (passaddhi) is related to physical and mental calmness and is therefore a direct antidote to the hindrance restlessness-and-worry (uddhaccakukkucca).^i19
 As part of the causal sequence leading to concentration, the awakening factor tranquillity leads to a happy state of mind, which in turn facilitates concentration.^i20
 Concentration, then, arises because of the development of calmness and lack of distraction.^i21
 According to the discourses, concentration with and without initial mental application (vitakka) can serve as an awakening factor.^i22
	The culmination of the development of the awakening factors comes with the establishment of equanimity (upekkhā), a balanced state of mind resulting from concentration.^i23
 Such refined mental balance and equipoise corresponds to a level of well-developed^pg251 satipaṭṭhāna, when the meditator is capable of dwelling “independently, without clinging to anything in the world”, as stipulated in the “refrain”.
	Practically applied, the whole set of the seven awakening factors can be understood to describe the progress of satipaṭṭhāna practice to this level of deep equanimity.
 On the basis of well-established mindfulness, one investigates the nature of subjective reality (viz. investigation-of-dhammas).
 Once sustained investigation gains momentum (viz. energy), with growing insight the object of contemplation becomes clearer and the meditator feels inspired (viz. joy) to continue with the practice.
 If at this point the danger of getting carried away by elation and agitation can be avoided, continued contemplation leads to a state of calmness, when the mind stays effortlessly with its meditation object without succumbing to distraction (viz. concentration).
 With maturing insight, this process culminates in a state of firm equanimity and detachment.
	It is at this point, when the inspired momentum of mindful investigation takes place against a background of tranquil composure, that the mental equipoise needed for the breakthrough to awakening comes about.
 At this level of practice, a deep sense of complete letting go prevails.
 In the discourses, such “letting go” as a central purpose of developing the bojjhaṅgas forms the culmination of a set of attributes frequently associated with the awakening factors.
 These attributes stipulate that, in order to actualize the awakening potential of the bojjhaṅgas, they need to be based on “seclusion” (viveka), on “fading away” (virāga), and on “cessation” (nirodha), since in this way they will lead to “letting go” (vossagga).^i24^pg252
	Equanimity and mental balance as the consummation of the other six awakening factors also constitutes the climax in the commentarial scheme of the insight knowledges,
 in which “equanimity in regard to all conditioned phenomena” (saṅkhārupekkhāñāṇa) marks the culmination of the series and the suitable mental condition for the event of realization.
benefits 2	^yl3(BENEFITS OF DEVELOPING THE AWAKENING FACTORS)
The profitable effect of the awakening factors stands in direct opposition to the detrimental repercussions of the hindrances, a contrast frequently mentioned in the discourses.^i25
 Both these sets form aspects of satipaṭṭhāna contemplation and are of central importance in cultivating the mental conditions conducive to realization.^i26
 According to the Buddha, these two aspects from among the contemplations of dhammas (removal of the hindrances and the establishment of the awakening factors) are the necessary conditions not only for realization, but also for developing mundane types of knowledge.^i27
	The central importance of developing awareness in regard to these two sets of mental qualities is also reflected in the fact that all Chinese and Sanskrit versions of contemplation of dhammas include the hindrances and the awakening factors.
 In contrast, none of these versions mentions the contemplation of the five aggregates, and several versions omit the contemplation of the sense-spheres and the contemplation of the four noble truths.^i28
 Thus what remains as the unanimously accepted core of contemplation of dhammas in all different versions are the five hindrances and the seven awakening^pg253 factors, a finding which underlines their importance.^i29
 This finding has a parallel in the Vibhaṅga, which also lists only these two meditation practices in its account of contemplation of dhammas.^i30
 To overcome the hindrances, to practise satipaṭṭhāna, and to establish the awakening factors are, indeed, according to several Pāli discourses, the key aspects and the distinctive features common to the awakenings of all Buddhas, past, present, and future.^i31
	Developing the awakening factors can be combined with a broad range of meditation exercises, including, for example, contemplation of a decaying corpse, the divine abodes, mindfulness of breathing, or contemplation of the three characteristics.^i32
 This indicates that to contemplate the awakening factors does not mean that one has to relinquish one’s primary object of meditation.
 Rather, one is aware of these seven mental qualities as facets of one’s progress towards insight during actual practice, and one consciously develops and balances them so that the contemplation of one’s primary object can give rise to awakening.
	There is a sense of mental mastery in this ability to oversee the development of insight during satipaṭṭhāna practice and to supervise the harmonious interaction of the awakening factors.
 The discourses illustratively compare this sense of mental mastery to being able to choose any garment from a full wardrobe.^i33
 A survey of the supportive factors listed in the commentaries for such mental mastery can be found in Fig. 12.2.
	As indicated by the discourses, a revelation of the awakening factors takes place only when a Buddha and his teaching have arisen.^i34^pg254
 Hence, in the eyes of the early Buddhists, the development of the awakening factors was a specifically Buddhist teaching.
 That other contemporary ascetics were also instructing their disciples to develop the awakening factors was, according to the commentaries, simply a case of imitation.^i35
	The relation of the seven awakening factors to the Buddha, together with their qualification as treasures on another occasion, is reminiscent of the universal monarch (cakkavatti rāja), who is similarly in the possession of seven precious treasures.^i36
 Just as the realization of universal sovereignty depends on those seven precious possessions and is heralded by the arising of the wheel-treasure (cakkaratana), so too the realization of awakening depends on seven mental treasures, the awakening factors, and is heralded by the arising of sati.
	The beneficial effect of the awakening factors is not confined to mental conditions, since several discourses report that their recollection sufficed for curing some arahants, including the Buddha himself, of physical illness.^i37
 Associations of cure and illness also underlie the formulation of the final meditation practice in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, contemplation of the four noble truths, to which I will turn in the next chapter.^pg255

^ym(DHAMMAS : THE FOUR NOBLE TRUTHS)
The instructions for the final exercise among the satipaṭṭhāna contemplations are:
	^sutta He knows as it really is, “this is dukkha”, he knows as it really is, “this is the arising of dukkha”, he knows as it really is, “this is the cessation of dukkha”, he knows as it really is, “this is the way leading to the cessation of dukkha”.^i1
dukkha	^ym1(THE IMPLICATIONS OF DUKKHA)
According to more detailed expositions found in other discourses, the first of the four noble truths relates dukkha to physical events such as disease and death, and to the mental displeasure that arises from being unable to satisfy desires and wishes.^i2
As the first noble truth points out, all these forms of dukkha can in the final analysis be traced to the basic fivefold clinging to existence by way of the aggregates.
	Although the Buddha placed much emphasis on dukkha, this does not mean that his analysis of reality was concerned only with the negative aspects of existence.
 In fact, an understanding of dukkha^pg257 and its arising leads to the third and the fourth noble truths, which are concerned with the positive values of freedom from dukkha and the practical path leading to that freedom.
 As the Buddha himself expressly stated, a realization of the four noble truths will be accompanied by happiness, and the noble eightfold path is a path productive of joy.^i3
This shows that understanding dukkha is not necessarily a matter of frustration and despair.
	Dukkha is often translated as “suffering”.
 Suffering, however, represents only one aspect of dukkha, a term whose range of implications is difficult to capture with a single English word.^i4
 Dukkha can be derived from the Sanskrit kha, one meaning of which is “the axle-hole of a wheel”, and the antithetic prefix duḥ (= dus), which stands for “difficulty” or “badness”.^i5
 The complete term then evokes the image of an axle not fitting properly into its hole.
 According to this image, dukkha suggests “disharmony” or “friction”.
 Alternatively dukkha can be related to the Sanskrit stha, “standing” or “abiding”, combined with the same antithetic prefix duḥ. ^i6
 Dukkha in the sense of “standing badly” then conveys nuances of “uneasiness” or of being “uncomfortable”.^i7
 In order to catch the various nuances of “dukkha”, the most convenient translation is “unsatisfactoriness”, though it might be best to leave the term untranslated.
	The need for careful translation of the term can be demonstrated with the help of a passage from the Nidāna Saṃyutta, where the Buddha stated that whatever is felt is included within dukkha.^i8
To understand dukkha here as an affective quality and to take it as implying that all feelings are “suffering” conflicts with the Buddha’s analysis of feelings into three mutually exclusive types, which are,^pg258
 in addition to unpleasant feeling, pleasant and neutral feelings.^i9
 On another occasion the Buddha explained his earlier statement that “whatever is felt is included within dukkha” to refer to the impermanent nature of all conditioned phenomena.^i10
 The changing nature of feelings, however, need not necessarily be experienced as “suffering”, since in the case of a painful experience, for example, change may be experienced as pleasant.^i11
 Thus all feelings are not “suffering”, nor is their impermanence “suffering”, but all feelings are “unsatisfactory”, since none of them can provide lasting satisfaction.
That is, dukkha as a qualification of all conditioned phenomena is not necessarily experienced as “suffering”, since suffering requires someone sufficiently attached in order to suffer.
noble truths	^ym2(THE FOUR NOBLE TRUTHS)
That to suffer is due to some form of attachment is in fact the implication of the second noble truth, according to which in order for the unsatisfactory nature of phenomena in the world to lead to actual suffering, it is necessary for craving (taṇhā) to be present.^i12
 As the third noble truth indicates, once all traces of attachment and craving have been eradicated by the arahant, such suffering is also eradicated.
 Thus “suffering”, unlike “unsatisfactoriness”, is not inherent in the phenomena of the world, only in the way in which the unawakened mind experiences them.
 This is indeed the underlying theme of the four noble truths as a whole: the suffering caused by attachment and craving can be overcome by awakening.
 For an arahant the unsatisfactory nature of all conditioned phenomena is no longer capable of causing suffering.^pg259
	The fourth noble truth then treats the conditions for such overcoming in detail, by depicting the practical way (magga, paṭipadā) to be followed.
 This noble eightfold path covers the central activities and qualities to be cultivated in order to bring about the transformation from ignorant worldling (puthujjana) to arahant. ^i13
 Since in this context right mindfulness (sammā sati) is juxtaposed with other factors such as view, speech, and action, the noble eightfold path sets the necessary framework for a development of satipaṭṭhāna.^i14
 In other words, satipaṭṭhāna becomes “sammā sati” only when and if it is undertaken interdependently with the other seven path factors.^i15
	The four noble truths express the essence of the Buddha’s awakening and form the central theme of what is recorded as his first formal discourse.^i16
 Since these four truths accord with reality, they are further qualified as “noble”, as the four “noble” truths.^i17
 The underlying fourfold structure parallels a fourfold method of diagnosis and prescription used in ancient Indian medicine (cf.  Fig. 13.1 below).^i18
 Similar nuances occur in several discourses which compare the^pg260 Buddha to a doctor and his teaching to medicine.^i19
 This presentation underlines the pragmatic orientation of the four noble truths as a practical investigation of reality.^i20
fig13.1	disease: dukkha 
virus: craving

^fig13.1(The fourfold structure of ancient Indian medicine and the four noble truths)
	Just as the footprints of all animals can fit within the footprint of an elephant, so too, whatever wholesome states there are, all of them are embraced by the four noble truths.^i21
 On the other hand, to believe that one can realize awakening without having understood the four noble truths is like trying to construct the upper floors of a house without having first constructed its lower floors and foundations.^i22
 Taken together, these statements underscore the central importance of the four noble truths.
contemplation2	^ym3(CONTEMPLATION OF THE FOUR NOBLE TRUTHS)
Each of the four noble truths makes its own demand on the practitioner: dukkha has to be “understood”, its origination has to be “abandoned”, its cessation has to be “realized”, and the practical path to this realization has to be “developed”.^i23
 In particular, the five aggregates are to be understood, ignorance and craving for existence are to be abandoned, knowledge and freedom are to be realized, and calm (samatha) and insight (vipassanā) are to be developed.^i24^pg261
	For the purpose of contemplation (anupassanā), the Dvayat-ānupassanā Sutta suggests that one may focus either on dukkha and its arising, or on its cessation and the path leading to its cessation.^i25
This corresponds to the two stage sequence found throughout the contemplation of dhammas: in each case recognizing the presence or absence of a particular phenomenon includes directing mindfulness to the causes of its presence or absence (see Fig. 13.2 below).
fig13.2	knowing dukkha → knowing the condition that leads to the arising of dukkha: craving 
 knowing the cessation of dukkha → knowing the condition that leads to the overcoming of dukkha: the noble eightfold path stage 1 stage 2
^fig13.2(Two stages in the contemplation of the four noble truths)
	Applied at a mundane level, contemplation of the four noble truths can be directed to patterns of clinging (upādāna) to existence occurring in everyday life, as,
 for example, when one’s expectations are frustrated, when one’s position is threatened, or when things do not go as one would want.^i26
 The task here is to acknowledge the underlying pattern of craving (taṇhā) that has led to the build-up of clinging and expectations, and also its resultant manifestation in some form of dukkha.
 This understanding in turn forms the necessary basis for letting go of craving (taṇhāya paṭinissagga).
 With such letting go, clinging and dukkha can, at least momentarily, be overcome.
 Practised in this way, one will become increasingly able to “fare evenly amidst the uneven”.^i27
	Not only do the four noble truths, listed as the final meditation practice in this satipaṭṭhāna, constitute the conclusion of this series of contemplations, they can also be related to each of the other contemplations of dhammas.^i28
 The commentaries go further by relating each of the meditation practices described throughout the Satipaṭṭhāna^pg262 Sutta to the scheme of the four noble truths.^i29
 In fact, the successful completion of any satipaṭṭhāna contemplation is the realization of Nibbāna, which corresponds to knowing the third noble truth “as it really is”.^i30
 Yet a full understanding of the third noble truth implies a penetration of all four, since each one is but a different facet of the same central realization.^i31
 Thus the four noble truths indeed form the culmination of any successful implementation of satipaṭṭhāna as the direct path to the realization of Nibbāna.^pg263
realization	^yn(REALIZATION)
The concluding passage of the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta gives a “prediction” of realization within a variable time period.
 The passage reads:
	^sutta If anyone should develop these four satipaṭṭhānas in such a way for seven years … six years … five years … four years … three years …two years … one year 
 … seven months … six months … five months… four months … three months … two months … one month …
 half a month … seven days, one of two fruits could be expected for him:
either final knowledge here and now, or, if there is a trace of clinging left, non-returning.
 So it was with reference to this that it was said:
Monks, this is the direct path for the purification of beings, for the surmounting of sorrow and lamentation, for the disappearance of dukkha and discontent, for acquiring the true method, for the realization of Nibbāna, namely, the four satipaṭṭhānas. ^i1
	I will first examine this prediction and discuss whether the progress towards realization is “gradual” or “sudden”.
 In the remainder of this chapter I will try to explore some ideas, perspectives, and suggestions on the goal of satipaṭṭhāna mentioned in the above passage, the “realization of Nibbāna”.^pg264
gradual	^yn1(GRADUAL AND SUDDEN)
According to the above prediction, satipaṭṭhāna practice has the potential to lead to the higher two of the four stages of awakening, non-returning and arahantship.
 The fact that this passage speaks immediately of the two higher stages of realization underlines the thoroughness of satipaṭṭhāna as the “direct path” to Nibbāna, drawing attention to its capability of leading “at least” to the eradication of the five lower fetters (saṃyojana), and therewith to complete freedom from sensual desire and aversion.^i2
	The other notable feature of this prediction is the variation in the length of time for satipaṭṭhāna practice to bear fruit.^i3
 Apparently, even someone of inferior ability can gain freedom from desire and aversion within a maximum of seven years, while someone of superior ability can do so within only seven days.^i4
 However, in evaluating this prediction it needs to be kept in mind that the number seven might have a more symbolic character in this context, indicating simply a complete period or cycle of time.^i5
	The prediction to realization in the Chinese Madhyama Āgama allows for even quicker awakening than the Pāli discourses, suggesting that realization can occur in the evening even if practice has begun only that same morning.^i6
 The possibility of such instant^pg265 realization through satipaṭṭhāna, within just one day or night, is also recognized by the Pāli commentaries,^i7
 while the discourses state this only in relation to the five “factors of striving” (pañca padhāniyaṅga).^i8
	The variations in the time periods for satipaṭṭhāna to bear fruit suggest that the decisive breakthrough to realization can happen at any time during correct practice.
 That is, once sati is well established (supatiṭṭhita), every moment is pregnant with potential awakening.
	This raises the question of the extent to which progress to realization follows a “gradual” pattern, as against an unexpected “sudden” reakthrough to awakening.^i9
	According to the discourses, it is impossible to measure exactly the quantity of defilements eradicated during a day of practice, just as a carpenter cannot measure the extent to which the handle of his adze has worn out during a day of use.^i10
 Nevertheless, just as after repeated use a carpenter will realize that the handle has worn out, so will a meditator, after repeated practice, realize that the defilements are growing weaker and are being eradicated.
 This simile indicates a gradual, though not precisely measurable, progress towards realization.
	The gradual nature of the progress towards realization is in fact a recurring theme in the discourses.^i11
 They explain that progress in the practice of the Dhamma deepens gradually, in a way comparable to the gradual deepening of the ocean.^i12
 A passage in the Aṅguttara Nikāya illustrates the gradual character of the process of purification with the example of gradually refining gold, where at first gross and middling impurities are removed, followed by finer impurities.^i13^pg266
 Similarly, in the realm of mental culture one at first removes the gross types of impurities, and is only then able to proceed to subtler levels.
	Another simile compares the practice of the threefold training in ethical conduct (sīla), concentration (samādhi), and wisdom (paññā) to a farmer, who has to plant and water his crop in due time.^i14
 Neither the farmer nor a practitioner of the threefold training has the magical power to say: “let my effort ripen now and bear fruit”, yet their constant effort will bring about the desired results.
 This simile indicates that progress to awakening follows a natural dynamic, comparable to the growth of plants in nature.
	Another canonical illustration of the progress towards realization is that of a hen sitting on her eggs.
 In due course the hen’s unrelenting sitting on her eggs will lead to the hatching of the chicks, just as, in due course, a practitioner’s unrelenting practice will lead to realization.^i15
 The chicks’ sudden emergence from their shells depends on a gradual process of inner development through the hen incubating the eggs.
 Similarly, the sudden breakthrough to Nibbāna depends on a gradual process of inner development and mental cultivation.
 Just as the hen cannot directly cause the chicks to break their shells, the breakthrough to Nibbāna cannot be directly made to happen.
 Both will occur in their own time, if the necessary conditions are in place.
	These passages clearly indicate that progress to awakening follows a gradual course.
 On the other hand, however, several realizations of stream-entry described in the discourses take place in a rather “sudden” manner, usually while listening to a discourse given by the Buddha.
 On considering these instances it seems almost as if to hear a discourse were sufficient for awakening, without much need to develop concentration gradually and engage in^pg267 insight meditation.^i16
 Here, however, it needs to be taken into consideration that if someone had realized stream-entry while meditating alone and in seclusion, this did not occasion a discourse and therefore was not recorded later.^i17
 But when someone realized streamentry while listening to the Buddha, the circumstances of the event caused it to become part of the later reported discourse.
 Thus it is to be expected that mainly the latter type of stream-entry realizations are recorded in the discourses.
 The same discourses do in fact document the potential for insight meditation to lead to the realization of stream-entry, which would be a meaningless statement if stream-entry were to depend solely on listening to a discourse.^i18
 Besides, if simply listening to and understanding a discourse were sufficient for realization, the Buddha would not have given so many exhortations to meditate.^i19
	A fairly condensed version of the gradual path can be found in one instance when a layman, despite being slightly drunk, was nevertheless able to gain stream-entry.
 On meeting the Buddha for the first time, this man sobered up and, after receiving a gradual^pg268 discourse, he then and there realized stream-entry.^i20
 In this particular case, the impact of personally meeting the Buddha was apparently so powerful that the breakthrough to stream-entry could take place, in spite of the fact that just a few moments earlier he had been inebriated.
 This layman is not the only such case, for the discourses also report the attainment of stream-entry at the time of death by another layman, who during his lifetime had been unable to abstain from alcohol.^i21
 A closer consideration of this discourse suggests that this layman was probably someone who had earlier progressed so far on the path that stream-entry had to take place (at the latest) at death, despite the fact that in the meantime his ethical foundation had deteriorated.^i22
	“Sudden” experiences of awakening can even lead all the way to arahantship.
 A case in point is the ascetic Bāhiya, whose full awakening came within minutes of his first meeting with the Buddha, immediately after receiving a short but penetrative instruction.^i23
 Bāhiya is certainly a prototype for “sudden” awakening.
 From consideration of the background to his awakening it becomes apparent that Bāhiya’s gradual development took place outside the Buddhist scheme of training.
 At the time of his encounter with the Buddha, Bāhiya already possessed a high degree of spiritual maturity, so that the brief instructions he received were sufficient to trigger a complete breakthrough.^i24^pg269
	Most of the instances mentioned so far reveal the powerful influence of the Buddha’s personal presence, which provided a potent catalyst for realization.
 On further perusing the discourses, additional examples of at times remarkably “sudden” realizations can be found.
 In an all-out attempt to reach realization, Ānanda finally gained full awakening at precisely the moment when he had given up striving and was about to lie down to rest.^i25
 Elsewhere, a nun, and on another occasion a monk, both on the verge of committing suicide, were “saved”, as it were, by awakening.^i26
 The commentaries even recount the story of an acrobat who gained realization while balancing on the top of his pole.^i27
 All these instances demonstrate the sudden and unpredictable nature of the event of awakening.
 They show that, although a gradual progress towards realization is the rule, the time required for such gradual preparation to bear fruit varies greatly according to the individual.
 This is also a central implication of the different time periods listed in the prediction of realization at the close of the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta.
	Thus early Buddhism proposes a gradual development as the necessary preparation for an eventual sudden breakthrough to realization.
 Viewing the path in this way, as a combination of these two aspects, reconciles the apparent contradiction between the frequently recurring emphasis in the discourses on the need for a particular type of conduct and for the development of knowledge, while other passages show that the realization of Nibbāna is not simply the result of conduct or knowledge.^i28
	Not only is it impossible to predict the precise moment when realization will take place, but, from the viewpoint of actual practice, even the gradual progress towards realization does not necessarily unfold uniformly.
 Instead, most practitioners experience a cyclic succession of progression and regression, oscillating within a fairly broad spectrum.^i29
 If these recurring cycles are considered within a^pg270 longer time frame, however, they reveal a slow but consistent gradual development, with an ever-increasing potential to culminate in a sudden realization of Nibbāna.
 To the implications of such a realization I will now turn in more detail.
ethical	^yn2(NIBBĀNA AND ITS ETHICAL IMPLICATIONS)
Taken in its literal sense, “Nibbāna” refers to the going out of a lamp or a fire.
 The image of an extinguished lamp occurs in fact several times in the discourses as a description of the experience of Nibbāna.^i30
 The corresponding verb nibbāyati means “to be extinguished” or “to become cool”.
 Such extinction is probably best understood in a passive sense, when the fires of lust, aversion, and delusion become cool through lack of fuel.^i31
 The metaphor of an extinguished fire in its ancient Indian context has nuances of calmness, independence, and release.^i32
	Judging by the evidence in the discourses, contemporary ascetics and philosophers used the term Nibbāna with predominantly positive connotations.
 The Brahmajāla Sutta, for example, lists five positions advocating Nibbāna “here and now”, which were five different conceptions of happiness: the pleasures of worldly sensuality and of the four levels of absorption.^i33
 Another discourse reports a wanderer taking “Nibbāna” to refer to health and mental well-being.^i34
 Similar positive connotations underlie the standard definition in the Pāli discourses, according to which Nibbāna stands for freedom from the unwholesome mental roots of lust, anger, and delusion.^i35^pg271
	This definition highlights in particular the ethical implications of realizing Nibbāna.
 These ethical implications require further examination, since at times realization of Nibbāna has been taken to imply the transcendence of ethical values.^i36
 Such transcendence seems, at first sight, to be advocated in the Samaṇamaṇḍikā Sutta, since this discourse associates awakening with the complete cessation of wholesome ethical conduct.^i37
 On similar lines, other passages in the Pāli canon speak in praise of going beyond both “good” and “evil”.^i38
	Taking the passage from the Samaṇamaṇḍikā Sutta first, a close examination of the discourse reveals that this particular statement does not refer to the abandoning of ethical conduct, but only to the fact that arahants no longer identify with their virtuous behaviour.^i39
 Regarding the other passages, which speak of “going beyond good and evil”, one needs to distinguish clearly between the Pāli terms translated as “good”, which can be either kusala or puñña.
 Although the two terms cannot be completely separated from each other in canonical usage, they often carry quite distinct meanings.^i40
 While puñña mostly denotes deeds of positive merit, kusala includes any type of wholesomeness, including the realization of Nibbāna.^i41
	What arahants have “gone beyond” is the accumulation of karma.
 They have transcended the generation of “good” (puñña) and of its opposite “evil” (pāpa).
 But the same cannot be said of wholesomeness (kusala).
 In fact, by eradicating all unwholesome (akusala) states of mind, arahants become the highest embodiment of wholesomeness (kusala).
 So much is this the case that, as indicated in the Samaṇamaṇḍikā Sutta, they are spontaneously virtuous and do not even identify with their virtue.^pg272
	Nibbāna, at least as understood by the Buddha, has quite definite ethical implications.
 Arahants are simply unable to commit an immoral act, since with their full realization of Nibbāna, all unwholesome states of mind have been extinguished.^i42
 The presence of any unwholesome thought, speech, or deed would therefore directly contradict the claim to being an arahant.
	In the Vīmaṃsaka Sutta, the Buddha applied this principle even to himself, openly inviting prospective disciples to examine his claim to full awakening by thoroughly investigating and observing his behaviour and deeds.^i43
 Only if no trace of unwholesomeness was found, he explained, would it be reasonable for them to place their confidence in him as a teacher.
 Even a Buddha should exemplify his teachings by his deeds, as indeed he did.
 That which the Buddha taught was in complete conformity with his behaviour.^i44
 This was so much the case that even after his full awakening the Buddha still engaged in those activities of restraint and careful consideration that had brought about purification in the first place.^i45
 If the Buddha made himself measurable by common standards of ethical purity, there is little scope for finding moral double-standards in his teaching.
	Even if awakening takes place only at the level of stream-entry, the experience of Nibbāna still has definite ethical consequences.
 A major consequence of realizing stream-entry is that stream-enterers become unable to commit a breach of ethical conduct serious^pg273 enough to lead to a lower rebirth.^i46
 Although they have not yet reached the level of ethical perfection of the Buddha or an arahant, the first realization of Nibbāna has already caused an irreversible ethical change.
	In order to provide additional perspectives on Nibbāna, I will now briefly consider some canonical descriptions of it.
early nibbana	^yn3(THE EARLY BUDDHIST CONCEPTION OF NIBBĀNA)
The early Buddhist conception of Nibbāna was not easily understood by contemporary ascetics and philosophers.
 The Buddha’s consistent refusal to go along with any of the four standard propositions about the survival or the annihilation of an arahant after death was rather bewildering to his contemporaries.^i47
 According to the Buddha, to entertain these different propositions was as futile as to speculate about the direction in which a fire had departed once it had gone out.^i48
	The Buddha found the existing ways of describing a state of realization or awakening inadequate to his realization.^i49
 His understanding of Nibbāna constituted a radical departure from the conceptions of the time.
 He was well aware of this himself, and after his awakening he immediately reflected on the difficulty of conveying what he had realized to others.^i50
	Despite these difficulties, the Buddha did try to explain the nature of Nibbāna on several occasions.
 In the Udāna, for instance, he spoke of Nibbāna as something beyond this world or another world, beyond coming, going, or staying, beyond the four elements representing material reality, and also beyond all immaterial realms.
 This ^pg274 “sphere” (āyatana), he pointed out, objectless and without any support, constitutes “the end of suffering”.^i51
 This description shows that Nibbāna refers to a dimension completely different from ordinary experiences of the world, and also different from experiences of meditative absorption.
	Other discourses refer to such a totally different experience as a “non-manifestative” consciousness.^i52
 A related nuance comes up in a somewhat poetic passage that compares the “unstationed” consciousness of an arahant to a ray of sunlight passing through the window of a room without an opposing wall: the ray does not land anywhere.^i53
	Another discourse in the Udāna describes Nibbāna with the help of a set of past participles as “not-born” (a-jāta), “not-become” (a-bhūta), “not-made” (a-kata), and “not-conditioned” (a-saṅkhata).^i54
 This passage again emphasizes that Nibbāna is completely “other”, in that it is not born or made, not produced or conditioned.
 It is owing to this “otherness” that Nibbāna constitutes freedom from birth (jāti), becoming (bhava), karma (kamma), and formations (saṅkhārā).^i55
 Birth (jāti) in a way symbolizes existence in time, while Nibbāna, not being subject to birth or death, is timeless or beyond time.^i56
	These passages show that Nibbāna is markedly different from any other experience, sphere, state, or realm.
 They clearly indicate that as long as there is even a subtle sense of a somewhere, a something, or a someone, it is not yet an experience of Nibbāna.^pg275
nibbana	^yn4(NIBBĀNA: NEITHER ALL-EMBRACING UNITY NOR ANNIHILATION)
In order further to clarify the distinctive character of the Buddha’s conception of Nibbāna, in the remainder of this chapter I will set it off against the realization of all-embracing unity (as envisaged by the “non-dual” religious traditions), and also against annihilationism.
 While early Buddhism does not deny the distinction between subject and object, it does not treat this distinction as particularly important.
 Both are insubstantial, the subject being nothing other than a complex of interactions with the world (object), while to speak of a “world” is to speak of what is being perceived by the subject.^i57
	Unity, in terms of subjective experience, entails a merging of the subject with the object.
 Experiences of this kind are often the outcome of deep levels of concentration.
 Nibbāna, on the other hand, entails a complete giving up of both subject and object, not a merger of the two.^i58
 Such an experience constitutes an “escape” from the entire field of cognition.^i59
 Although Nibbāna partakes of non-duality in so far as it has no counterpart,^i60 its implications nevertheless go far beyond experiences of oneness or unity.^i61^pg276
	Experiences of oneness were actually not unknown to the early Buddhist community, but even their most refined forms, experienced with the immaterial attainments, were not considered to be the final goal.^i62
 Just as the Buddha himself did not feel satisfied with what he had experienced based on the indications received from his first teachers,^i63 so he admonished his disciples to go beyond and transcend such “transcendental” experiences.^i64
 Some of his disciples had achieved various non-dual experiences, while others had realized full awakening without experiencing any of the immaterial attainments.^i65
 The latter were the living proof that such attainments, far from being identifiable with Nibbāna, are not even necessary for its realization.
	In order properly to assess the early Buddhist concept of Nibbāna, it needs not only to be distinguished from views based on experiences of unity, but also has to be differentiated from the theories of annihilation held among the deterministic and materialistic schools of ancient India.
 On several occasions the Buddha was in fact wrongly accused of being an annihilationist.^i66
 His humorous reply to such allegations was that he could rightly be called so if this meant the annihilation of unwholesome states of mind.
	A consideration of the discourses shows that Nibbāna is described in both positive and negative terms.
 Negative expressions occur^pg277 frequently in a practical context, indicating the work still to be done.^i67
 Other passages, however, refer to Nibbāna with a variety of positive epithets, calling it a state of peace, of purity, and of freedom, sublime and auspicious, wonderful and marvellous, an island, a shelter, and a refuge.^i68
 The happiness of freedom contingent upon having realized Nibbāna constitutes the highest possible form of happiness.^i69
 Described as the source of supreme happiness, as a state of freedom, sublime and auspicious, Nibbāna seems to have little in common with mere annihilation.
	In fact, according to the Buddha’s penetrating analysis the attempt to annihilate self still revolves around a sense of selfhood, though being motivated by disgust with this self.
 In this way annihilationism is still in bondage to a sense of self, comparable to a dog moving in circles around a post to which it is bound.^i70
 Such craving for non-existence (vibhavataṇhā) forms indeed an obstacle to the realization of Nibbāna.^i71
 As the Dhātuvibhaṅga Sutta explains, to think in terms of: “I shall not be” is a form of conceiving as much as the thought: “I shall be”.^i72
 Both are to be left behind in order to proceed to awakening.
	To maintain that an arahant will be annihilated at death is a misunderstanding, since such a proposition argues the annihilation of^pg278 something that cannot be found in a substantial sense even while one is still alive.^i73
 Therefore any statement concerning the existence or annihilation of an arahant after death turns out to be meaningless.^i74
 What Nibbāna does imply is that the ignorant belief in a substantial self is annihilated, an “annihilation” which has already taken place with stream-entry.
 With full awakening, then, even the subtlest traces of grasping at a sense of self are forever “annihilated”, which is but a negative way of expressing the freedom gained through realization.
 Fully awakened to the reality of selflessness, the arahant is free indeed, like a bird in the sky, leaving no tracks.^i75^pg279
conculsion	^yo(CONCLUSION)
The Buddha once said he would be able to answer questions about satipaṭṭhāna without repeating himself or exhausting his answers, even if the inquiry were to continue for a whole century.^i1
If the topic of satipaṭṭhāna could not be exhausted by the Buddha, then clearly the present work can at best attempt only to offer a starting point for further discussion and exploration.
 Nevertheless, the time has now come to sum up the present discussion by attempting to highlight some key aspects of satipaṭṭhāna.
 In addition, I will place satipaṭṭhāna within a wider context by considering its place and importance in the context of the Buddha’s teaching.
key aspect	^yo1(KEY ASPECTS OF SATIPAṬṬHĀNA)
The “direct path” to Nibbāna described in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta presents a comprehensive set of contemplations that progressively reveal ever subtler aspects of subjective experience.
 The mental qualities required for this direct path of satipaṭṭhāna are, according to the “definition” part of the discourse, a balanced and sustained application of effort (ātāpī), the presence of clearly knowing (sampajāna), and a balanced state of mind, free from desires (abhijjhā) and discontent (domanassa).
 These three qualities revolve like the three spokes of a wheel around the central mental quality of sati.^pg280
	As a mental quality, sati represents the deliberate cultivation and a qualitative improvement of the receptive awareness that characterizes the initial stages of the perceptual process.
 Important aspects of sati are bare and equanimous receptivity, combined with an alert, broad, and open state of mind.
 One of the central tasks of sati is the de-automatization of habitual reactions and perceptual evaluations.
 Sati thereby leads to a progressive restructuring of perceptual appraisal, and culminates in an undistorted vision of reality “as it is”.
 The element of non-reactive watchful receptivity in sati forms the foundation for satipaṭṭhāna as an ingenious middle path which neither suppresses the contents of experience nor compulsively reacts to them.
	This mental quality of sati has a broad variety of possible applications.
 Within the context of satipaṭṭhāna, sati can range from the coarsest activities, such as defecation and urination, all the way up to the most sublime and exalted state, when sati is present as a mental factor during the breakthrough to Nibbāna.
 A similar breadth of applications can be found in the context of calmness meditation, where the tasks of sati range from recognizing the presence of a hindrance, to emerging with awareness from the highest meditative absorption.
	On the basis of the central characteristics and qualities of satipaṭṭhāna described in the “definition” and in the “refrain”, the main thrust of satipaṭṭhāna can be summed up as:
 Keep Calmly Knowing Change 
	With the injunction “keep” I intend to cover both continuity and comprehensivity in satipaṭṭhāna contemplation.
 Continuity of awareness underlies the quality “diligent” (ātāpī) mentioned in the “definition”.
 The element of comprehensiveness comes up in the “refrain”, which enjoins to contemplate both internally (ajjhatta) and externally (bahiddhā), that is, to comprehensively contemplate both oneself and others.
	The qualification “calmly” stands for the need, mentioned in the “definition” and the “refrain”, to undertake satipaṭṭhāna free from desires and discontent (vineyya loke abhijjhādomanassaṃ),
 and also free from any clinging or dependence (anissito ca viharati, na ca kiñci loke upādiyati).
	The verb “knowing” echoes the frequent use of the verb pajānāti in the discourse.
 Such “knowing” represents the quality of bare mindfulness (sati) combined with clearly knowing (sampajāna), both ^pg281 mentioned in the “definition”.
 Both occur also in the “refrain”, which speaks of contemplating merely for the sake of “bare knowledge and continuous mindfulness” (ñāṇamattāya paṭissatimattāya).
	The “refrain” also explains the particular aspect of body, feelings, mind, and dhammas to which this quality of knowing is to be directed, namely their arising and passing away (samudaya-vayadhammānupassī).
 Such contemplation of impermanence can either lead to an understanding of conditionality, or form the basis for understanding the other two characteristics of conditioned phenomena, dukkha and anattā.
 It is this growth of insight into the unsatisfactory and empty nature of conditioned existence, based on the direct realization of impermanence, to which I intend to refer with the term “change”.
	The essential features of satipaṭṭhāna contemplation can also be brought out visually.
 In Fig. 15.1 below I have attempted to illustrate^pg282 the relationship between the “definition”, the four satipaṭṭhānas, and the “refrain”.
 The central aspects mentioned in the “refrain” are in the centre of the figure, while the qualities listed in the “definition” re repeated in each cone.
 These four cones represent the four satipaṭṭhānas, each of which can become the main focus of practice and lead to deep insight and realization.
fig15.1	^fig15.1(Central characteristics and aspects of satipaṭṭhāna)
As the diagram indicates, undertaking satipaṭṭhāna contemplation of body, feelings, mind, or dhammas requires the combination of all the four qualities listed in the “definition”.
 Such contemplation leads to the development of the four aspects of satipaṭṭhāna found in the centre of the above figure and mentioned in the “refrain” of the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta.
	In this diagram I intend to show that each of the four satipaṭṭhānas constitutes a “door” or perhaps a “stepping-stone”.
 The contemplations included under the four satipaṭṭhānas are not ends in themselves, rather, they are only tools for developing the central aspects described in the “refrain”.
 Whichever door or stepping-stone is used to develop insight, the main task is to employ it skilfully in order to gain a comprehensive and balanced vision of the true nature of subjective experience.
	In the Saḷāyatanavibhaṅga Sutta the Buddha spoke of three “satipaṭṭhānas” distinct from the practices listed in the four satipaṭṭhāna scheme.^i2
This suggests that the contemplations described in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta do not determine the only proper and suitable ways for carrying out “satipaṭṭhāna” contemplation, but only recommendations for possible applications.
 Thus the practice of satipaṭṭhāna is not necessarily restricted to the range of objects explicitly listed in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta.
	The contemplations in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta progress from gross to subtle aspects of experience.
 It should be kept in mind, however, that this discourse represents a theoretical model of satipaṭṭhāna, not a case study.
 In actual practice, the different contemplations described in the discourse can be combined in a variety of ways and it would be a misunderstanding to take the progression in the discourse as prescribing the only possible sequence for the development of satipaṭṭhāna.
	The flexible interrelation of the satipaṭṭhāna contemplations in actual practice can be illustrated by taking a cross-section, as it were, ^pg283 through the direct path of satipaṭṭhāna.
 Such a sectional view would resemble a twelve-petalled flower (see Fig. 15.2 below), with the main object of contemplation (here the breath is used as an example) constituting the centre of the “flower”.
fig15.2	^fig15.2(Dynamic interrelation of the satipaṭṭhāna contemplations)
	From awareness of the main object of meditation, the dynamics of contemplation can at any given moment lead to any of the other satipaṭṭhāna exercises, and then revert to the main object.
 That is, from being aware of the process of breathing, for example, awareness might turn to any other occurrence in the realm of body, feelings, mind, or dhammas which has become prominent, and then revert to the breath.
 Otherwise, in the event that the newly-arisen object of meditation should require sustained attention and deeper investigation, it can become the new centre of the flower, with the former object turned into one of the petals.
	Any meditation practice from the four satipaṭṭhānas can serve as the main focus of insight contemplation and lead to realization.
 At the same time, meditations from one satipaṭṭhāna can be related with those from other satipaṭṭhānas.
 This indicates the flexibility of the satipaṭṭhāna scheme, which allows freedom for variation and combination according to the character and level of development of the meditator.
 Understood in this way, practising satipaṭṭhāna should 
 breath noble truths sense-spheres awakening factors corpse elements anatomical parts postures activities aggregates hindrances mind feelings ^pg284 not be a question of practising one or another satipaṭṭhāna, but of contemplating one as well as the others.
 In fact, during the deeper stages of the practice, when one is able to abide “independent and free from clinging to anything in the world”, the practice of satipaṭṭhāna progresses from any particular object or area to a more and more comprehensive form of contemplation that embraces all aspects of experience.
 Expressed in the terms of Fig. 15.2 it would be as if, when the sun was about to set, the twelve petals of the flower gradually came together to form a single bud.
 Practised in this way, satipaṭṭhāna becomes an integrated four-faceted survey of one’s present experience, taking into account its material, affective, and mental aspects from the perspective of the Dhamma.
 In this way one’s present experience becomes an occasion for swift progress on the direct path to realization.
importance	^yo2(THE IMPORTANCE OF SATIPAṬṬHĀNA)
The Buddha recommended the practice of satipaṭṭhāna to newcomers and beginners, and also included advanced practitioners and arahants among the cultivators of satipaṭṭhāna.^i3
	For the beginner embarking on satipaṭṭhāna practice, the discourses stipulate a basis in ethical conduct and the presence of “straight” view as necessary foundations.^i4
 According to a passage in the Aṅguttara Nikāya, the practice of satipaṭṭhāna leads to overcoming weakness with regard to the five precepts.^i5
 This suggests that the ethical foundation required to begin satipaṭṭhāna might be weak at the outset, but will be strengthened as practice proceeds.
 Similarly, the “straight” view mentioned earlier might refer to a preliminary degree of motivation and understanding that will develop ^pg285 further with the progress of satipaṭṭhāna contemplation.^i6
Additional requisites for undertaking satipaṭṭhāna practice are to limit one’s activities, to refrain from gossiping, excessive sleep, and socializing, and to develop sense restraint and moderation with regard to food.^i7
	It might already have come as a surprise that a newcomer to the path should be encouraged to cultivate satipaṭṭhāna right away.^i8
 That the Buddha and his fully-awakened disciples should still engage in the practice of satipaṭṭhāna might be even more surprising.
 Why would one who has realized the goal continue with satipaṭṭhāna?
	The answer is that arahants continue with insight meditation because for them this is simply the most appropriate and pleasant way to spend their time.^i9
 Proficiency in satipaṭṭhāna, together with delight in seclusion, are indeed distinguishing qualities of an arahant. ^i10
 Once true detachment has set in, the continuity of insight meditation becomes a source of delight and satisfaction.
 Thus satipaṭṭhāna is not only the direct path leading to the goal, but also the perfect expression of having realized the goal.
 To borrow from the poetic language of the discourses: path and Nibbāna merge into one, like one river merging with another.^i11^pg286
	A similar nuance underlies the final part of the “refrain”, according to which contemplation continues for the sake of continued contemplation.^i12
 This indicates that there is no point at which a practitioner goes beyond the practice of meditation.
 Thus the relevance of satipaṭṭhāna extends from the very beginning of the path all the way through to the moment of full realization, and beyond.
	The continued relevance of formal meditation practice even for arahants is documented in various discourses.
 These discourses show that the Buddha and his disciples were always given to meditation, irrespective of their level of realization.^i13
 The Buddha was well known in contemporary ascetic circles for being in favour of silence and retreat.^i14
 An illustrative episode in the Sāmaññaphala Sutta reports the Buddha and a large congregation of monks meditating in such deep silence that an approaching king feared being led into an ambush, because it seemed impossible to him that so many people could be assembled together without making any noise.^i15
 The Buddha’s appreciation of silence went so far that he would readily^pg287 dismiss noisy monks or lay supporters from his presence.^i16
 If the hustle and bustle around him reached a level he found excessive, he was capable of just walking off by himself, leaving the congregation of monks, nuns, and lay followers to themselves.^i17
 Seclusion, he explained, was a distinctive quality of the Dhamma. ^i18
	The discourses report that even after his full awakening the Buddha still went into solitary silent retreat.^i19
 Even outside of intensive retreat, distinguished visitors were sometimes not allowed to approach him if he was engaged in his daily meditation.^i20
 According to the Buddha’s own statement in the Mahāsuññata Sutta, if while abiding in emptiness meditation he was visited by monks, nuns, or laity, his mind inclined to seclusion to such an extent that he would talk to them in a way that was intended to dismiss them.^i21
	His secluded lifestyle earned the Buddha some undeserved ridicule from other ascetics, who insinuated that he might fear being vanquished in debate with others.^i22
 This, however, was not the case; the Buddha was not afraid of debate or of anything else.
 His ^pg288 secluded and meditative lifestyle was simply the appropriate expression of his realization, and at the same time a way of setting an example to others.^i23
	The passages mentioned so far clearly show the importance given in the early Buddhist community to retiring into seclusion and engaging in the practice of intensive meditation.
 This importance is also reflected in the statement that practice of the four satipaṭṭhānas, together with removing the hindrances and establishing the awakening factors, constitutes a common feature of the awakening of all Buddhas, past, present, and future.^i24
 In fact, not only Buddhas, but all those who have realized or will realize awakening, do so by overcoming the hindrances, establishing satipaṭṭhāna, and developing the awakening factors.^i25
 In view of the fact that both the hindrances and the awakening factors are objects of contemplation of dhammas, it becomes evident that satipaṭṭhāna is an indispensable ingredient for growth in the Dhamma.^i26
 Little wonder then that the Buddha equated neglecting satipaṭṭhāna with neglecting the path to freedom from dukkha. ^i27
	The relevance of satipaṭṭhāna to all the Buddha’s disciples is also indicated by the fact that, according to the discourses, many nuns were accomplished practitioners of satipaṭṭhāna. ^i28
 Several instances also refer to lay-meditators proficient in satipaṭṭhāna contemplation.^i29
 These instances clearly show that the word “monks” (bhikkhave), used in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta by the Buddha as a form of ^pg289 address to his audience, was not intended to restrict the instructions to fully ordained monks.^i30
	Although the practice of satipaṭṭhāna is clearly not limited to members of the monastic community, it nevertheless holds particular benefits for them, since it counters tendencies towards personal and communal decline.^i31
 As the Buddha pointed out, once a monk or a nun has practised satipaṭṭhāna for a sufficient length of time, nothing in the world can tempt them to disrobe and forsake their way of life, since they have become thoroughly disenchanted with worldly temptations.^i32
 Well established in satipaṭṭhāna, they have become truly self-reliant and are no longer in need of any other form of protection or refuge.^i33
	The wholesome effects of satipaṭṭhāna are not restricted to oneself.
 The Buddha emphatically advised that one should encourage one’s friends and relatives to also practise satipaṭṭhāna.^i34
 In this way, satipaṭṭhāna practice can become a tool for assisting others.
 The Buddha once illustrated the proper procedure for such assistance with the example of two acrobats about to perform a balancing act together.^i35
 In order for both to perform safely, each first of all had to pay attention to his own balance, not to the balance of his companion.
 Similarly, the Buddha advised, one should first of all establish balance within oneself by developing satipaṭṭhāna.
 Based on establishing such inner balance one will be able to relate to external circumstances with patience, non-violence, and compassion, and therefore be truly able to benefit others.
	The simile of the two acrobats suggests that self-development by way of satipaṭṭhāna forms an important basis for the ability to help others.
 According to the Buddha, to try to assist others without first ^pg290 having developed oneself is like trying to save someone from a quagmire while one is oneself sinking.^i36
 He compared attempts to lead others to realize what one has not yet realized oneself to someone carried away by a swift river, yet attempting to help others to cross it.^i37
	All these passages document the central position and importance of satipaṭṭhāna in the context of the Buddha’s teaching.
 Indeed, it is the practice of satipaṭṭhāna, the systematic development of this unobtrusive quality of mindfulness, that constitutes the direct path to the realization of Nibbāna, to the perfection of wisdom, to the highest possible happiness, and to unsurpassable freedom.^i38^pg291
